60,i purchase this simply for the cameras and to that i be in love as a phone though it be a limit yet vanilla experience chipset wise you will be hard press to find a faster android on the market it be blazingly fast and seem to retain its speed overtime also to mention be the battery life which be somewhere between amaze and epic the fast charge will put enough juice in the device in 30 mins to keep it power for a day or so this can be a bite troublesome though as its fast speed and fantastic battery life be a result of aggressive task kill and limit background process this frequently cause issue for some apps that be work in the background or even stream audio this can be remedied with exceptions but still worth mention 2 sim card can be use nativly and it be hand down the best software i have ever use for manage two sims no other chinese phone have come close to that level of plug and play with hot swap sims the most excite part though and exclusively what i pay for be the sensor and photo ai the zoom be simply incredible you will not believe it at first it zoom optically for a very low noise zoom push the limit trigger the ai which do a fantastic job of stabilization at up to 50x it be even able to capture color and exposure accurately at range the night mode be also incredibly powerful but demand a tripod or very steady hand essentially a long exposure but with the miracle of the sensor that somehow fill in the detail at a level your eye can not even see,huawei,1,1,0
61,beautiful chinese phone,huawei,1,1,0
62,the phone look real cool and work well enough especially for the price the worst and most frustrate part for me be the processor sometimes the phone just take a minute,huawei,0,0,1

69,good,huawei,1,1,0
70,ive be use this phone for 3 weeks the most impressive thing about this phone in my opinion be not the camara dont get me wrong the camera be as good as everybody else say however i dont think the image quality here can replace what i get from my dslr or my mirror less its just above average when compare to other phone in the market and have full set of lenses that fit in my pocket be quite a new experience now back to what i love the most about p30 pro its the battery when i open the box for the first time the phone have 33 of battery i receive the phone at work around 1030am and didnt have a chance to recharge it i run around all day that day and use the phone like usual make call texts email read document web search gps etc only didnt have a chance to watch video or listen to music by 930pm 11 hours later the battery go down to 1 and i just barely make it home so 33 for 11 hours with normal usage be pretty good for me consider my old phone can never last more than 4 hours in the same circumstance after the first day i always start the day with 95100 battery my days normally start at 830am to 1000pm ive always come home with 40 leave after 135 hours this be definitely new to me no more powerbank no more look around for an outlet to charge my phone no more fight over the charger with my wife and kid when be outside no more rush to my bedroom to charge my die phone when i get home etc i can use my p30 pro as much as i like when im outside without worry about put the phone in battery save mode when i come home now i can relax sit in the live room a bite spend time in the kitchen a bite unlike before that i have to run to my bedroom to charge my phone right away because its about to die in 5 minutes what a difference sensation just an fyi my old phone be a 2 years old samsung with 3600mah battery my wifes be a year old iphone that battery always run out at the end of the day p30 pro last all the way through the night the second best thing about this phone be the charger i use samsung all these years and very familiar with their fast charge however ive never see anything like huaweis super charge its just crazy fast a lot of time at night i go to bed and forget to charge my phone wake up at 500am to realize it and start charge the phone usually the phone have about 35 leave after take shower and get dress which take me about 20 minutes once im do the phone will be charge up to 90 already if i wait 15 minutes more itll go up to 100 couple days ago i spend a lot of time wait for people so i watch a lot of videos to kill time i use up the battery more than usual but still have 26 leave by the time i get home so watch and stream video consume more power but wouldnt completely drain out the battery of p30 pro enough with the battery as i mention before the camera be good for as long as you dont expect the full frame or apsc quality for smartphone however this be absolutely the best for still photos video unfortunately be another matter although p30 pro can shoot 4k but its only limit at 30fps if youre look for a better video capability samsung s10 be a better choice because it can shoot 4k60 the p30 pro on the other hand be limit even at 1080p because its only do 60fps while s10 can go upto 1080p240 big difference the screen be only full hd not quad like s10 but its still amoled and look good with every task i have no complain about the quality of the screen in fact i already drop this phone once in my garage face down theres no crack or scratch and still work perfectly fine so i know its durable the emui i dont know why people complain so much about huawei interface some people say its look too much like iphone with all the apps present on screen well theres a drawer too if you choose to use it and make it feel more like samsung to me there be some feature i like that easier than samsung and there be some feature thats harder as well no matter which phone you choose itll never be 100 perfect so why complain i will conclude my review here that this p30 pro be one of the best in the market right now especially the battery and charger i might have something else to add but thatd be in the future add comment 1 i be so busy lately and only have a chance to walk around a bite last night so id like to add some photos i take with p30 pro the first 3 photos just to show the difference between each lenses from wide angle to 10x zoom actually its more like 16mm 27mm and 270mm prime,huawei,1,1,0
71,ever since the huawei p20 pro i no longer consider apple in the mix this phone be amaze fast and the camera the camera be like hollywood style the low light picture tuen out amaze and it have a telescopic camera ergo be great and it be dual sim i use att card in the usa and have chip for canada brasil and mexico and the phone work great in all locations while in the usa i use two seperate american chip one for work relate item and my personal number a fantastic feature be that both sims be 4g at the same time in non huawei phone you could only have 4g on one chip but not both at the same time this phone allow both sim chip to run on 4g simultaneously battery life be great crancks enough power that i can charge others people phone this be an amaze phone and if you love picture you wont find a better phone on the market today with phone connectivity i have not have an issue the charger be fast in half hour it go from 1 to 78 charge my phone can handle water i jump into the water of a beach in phone go underwater brazil and no issue the phone somehow know how it be in water and protective feature turn on it include an earphone jack adapter for headphone thatnhave the traditional jack as well as a set of usb c head phone also one reviewer claim it do not record in 4k that be an untrue statement it do record in 4k i attach a photo of the resolution selection page the default be fhd for 4k you just have to select in the settings that you want to record in 4k great phone,huawei,1,1,0

83,now that google end support and security update for huawei phonesi have a 900 paper weight oh well at least you can still expect this phone to send your personal data back to china,huawei,1,1,0
84,its a good phone but before you decide to buy it you would like to know this 1 its slippery you will loos it order a flip cover to protect it and give you a good grip 2 its a usbc connector so you can not charge or connect it with your old uusb cable 3 you can not connect your lovely koss porta pro headseth as there be no jack plug unless you have a usbc to jack adapter 4 if you dont have bluetooth in your car theres no jack to connect the sound unless you have a usbc to jack adapter 5 the wide angle be nice not a lot but nice to have 6 the telezoom be nothing but impressive and so be the low light capabilities where most phone have a usb connector and a jack for the headseth this phone have a usbc connector that can connect a usbc earpiece with microphone include so if you want to both charge and listen to music via a jack connector you need a combine audio usb splitter cable to do both at the same time not stay with the standard solution here and keep the audio jack be the only mistake theyve make i think,huawei,1,1,0
85,weve have it for a few days and so far this be a great phone with an awesome screen and feature run fast look nice work with our network and you cant beat the price the phone be completely worth it the only thing im not completely in love with be the camera be not bad it take pretty good picture but previously own a zte axon 7 and the quality be lower on the huawei y9 which we dont mind honestly since this huawei be not as expensive as the axon it be expect but for the price be definitely a must buy we be weary of buy it because we saw a couple review and answer say it might only take 2g or 3g but it receive a 4g signal and everything work smoothly we be currently use cricket wireless as our service provider we have only purchase one phone to check if we like it and if it work with cricket and now be ready to make another purchase because we love it,huawei,1,1,0
86,this phone be exactly what i be look for a very large bright screen loud speaker wish it have stereo speakers but hey no complaints here and even with 3 gigs of ram its still fast with the kirin 710 processor also cames with android oreo out of the box the huawei cloud service that they offer isnt available in the us but no big deal when google keep everything on their cloud i do use the help app to ask some question about settings and get answer back within in a few hours from huaweis help team overall a great phone at a great price buy it,huawei,1,1,0
87,closest phone to the honor 8x which isnt release in the us the screen be huge very bright the design be beautiful with blue back though which it be glass like the 8x the phone be fast and snappy though ram management be aggressive and you will be reload apps the battery life be phenomenal last 2 days sometimes people tell me at time they call me but i do not receive call if it wasnt for that i would give 5 star,huawei,1,1,0
88,at this price point you cant go wrong this be a quality phone without doubt large screen with good color saturation and clarity good sound a plethora of native settings to tweak the phone to suit your visual and performance need this be a not a samsung note 10 but for the feature and performance at a little over 200 this beat the brake off a phone that cost 600 more,huawei,1,1,0

164,i need a replacement phone due to a swell battery on my huawei mate se i discover overcharge a cell battery increase gas in the battery from a phone tech so dont leave your phone constantly charge folks i could have have the battery replace by a tech for 55 but decide to treat myself to a slight upgrade i be very happy with the mate se so i go to youtube for review of huawei phone after see a number of very favorable review of the p30 lite i order this phone late last saturday and receive it the follow monday i have debate spend 500 or more for a high end phone but learn a lot of the technology in more expensive phone be dedicate to phototaking technology im not a selfieaddict so i let common sense take over and opt for a phone in the 300 range i find a vendor that sell this phone for 259 and 2 day delivery i didnt want to wait a week in the event my old phone die the phone come with the describe accessories usbc cord screen protector charge brick and a very thin rubberize case the phone be very sleek and slippery id suggest put the case on immediately so it doesnt slide out of your hand i originally place it on a glass table top and it slide all over the place the phone have a massive 128 gig internal storage capacity i put a 128 gig sd card in the 2nd slot i cant imagine what id fill the phone with but i think most of us have discover over time that we tend to fill our phone up with pics and music ill have plenty of room to download netflix vids to watch when im on a treadmill out of the box the phone be charge to about 56 and be load with android version 9 the on speaker at the bottom be very loud i tend to link to a bluetooth speaker or headphones for music and videos anyway i havent try a phonecall on speakerphone yet the phone seem only able to pickup the 25 ghz channel on your wireless network export all my apps and settings from my old phone to the p30 be almost seamless use huaweis phone clone app you can obtain it in the google play store for your old phone this turn both phone into hotspots and you keep both phone close to each other and 99 of my apps and settings be export by default all your apps will be display over multiple screen i think i would have to spend hours arrange my apps but discover the set see attach pic for home screen style under settingshome screen wallpaperhome screen style then select the bottom choice drawer this bring almost all my app icons i have from my old phone where i nest similar apps in their own drawers label music tool etc this save me hours of work all your apps will now be in a drawer that look like a circle with 3 row of 3 dot you can then drag whatever apps out and align them how you wish if you drag one app into another you create a i think theyre call drawers which you can then label this help categorize apps ease of use be relative if youre new to the android world go through all the settings can be daunt and theres lot of settings under the hood im still discover many i appreciate builtin apps like app lock which enable you to protect your apps like email and bank by prevent use by other people you unlock the app either by your fingerprint or passcode i enable fingerprint and facial recognition to unlock the phone the responsiveness be instantaneous one trick with the fingerprint scanner on the rear of the phone when look at picture you can use a finger to swipe to the next picture so you can view a gallery of of photos with one hand instead of two there be a notch at the top of the phone which can be hide via settings i find the camera much faster than my old phone and more variety in how to take take photos the photos be crisp and capture color fairly accurately be they iphone quality pics no the camera isnt a big deal for me but its nice to have a camera that take good quality photos the digital zoom work very well send pics via mms seem fine to me unlike another reviewer theres no native internet call feature but theres 3rd party apps that support that but you will be issue a new phone number scroll be fast and smooth i find one little quirk when view youtube the video be about 20 smaller than the screen you can go fullscreen use your thumb and forefinger to stretch to fullscreen it may be a power save feature im not sure huawei be know for its extremely long power use youll have to experiment in settings to find the one right power set for you theres plenty more feature to be discover but at this price point this phone be a winner,huawei,1,1,0

346,my old phone with 16 gb work very well for me last three years but my usage start to demand more storage the price be right for this 128 gb phone i have it for one day now overall i be quite happy with it the lag time do in negotiation be quite negligible to me and flow be quite smooth i do not know how good the camera be although the few picture and videos i take be quite acceptable i generally use a canon slr camera for photos and this be just to be use for quickie and convenient use only it do not detect my 5g or ac wifi but somebody in the review have always point out so it be within my expectation use speedtest with 24ghz wifi i get 747 mbps download speed i be not sure if it be just my cloud content or it be google problem but i like to warn that if you google backup to install all the apps previously instal in the other phone it create a display sleep problem the phone would go to sleep every eight second if there be no activity no matter what battery performance or sleep timeout set i change to i have to solve the problem by reset the phone to the original factory set and reinstall each application manually one by one through the play store i get the solution from other users in the internet have the similar problem with huawei phone and other brand phone so this maybe a common problem with the google backup likely it could be the content store in this backup but i do not care to find out as i do not have the problem any more it also seem that i have an easier time to synchronize the windows 10 contact and calendar apps through the outlookcom with the phone builtin contact and calendar apps than my old phone it take me about three hours to reinstall all the apps about 40 of them and to complete the email contact and calendar setups,huawei,1,1,0
347,i be one of the last holdouts with a windows phone and know i have to buy something to replace it i have android years ago so i think i would just go back to it plus apple doesnt make products in this price range really my biggest fear be try to transfer data and it do prove to be try and not completely successful get photos music have to buy a converter from wma to aac format and my ringtone ok only get sms texts transfer use an app but lose my mms and contact oh well i just make do i be a very light smart phone user so not a big deal this phone itself i really like ultimately pop in the sim card from windows phone and this one take off screen be great for me i get my apps load and i be very satisfy with this phone photos be certainly good enough i cannot seem to figure out how to get a shadow screen to open up when i take it out of my pocket i always have to push the button probably a security thing i dont use the fingerprint scanner opt out of that so i cannot comment on it like that it have a headphone jack and i add a 128 sd card i be a light user of this phone i be not on it constantly probably twenty texts a day the occasional phone call some news read etc so far the battery have last days for me at least 3 and i be still at 40 i turn off location bluetooth and notifications since i dont use them daily and i be sure that help with the battery this phone be faster than my nokia windows phone 950 which be one of their better phone at the time for under 300 i think this be a fantastic phone my understand be that this phone will be support into the future even if huawei be ban from google support as a kind of grandfathering for products already in consumer hand it be a pretty phone peacock blue and feel solid to me i wouldnt hesitate to buy another update 8272019 as this be an international version the android stuff be not as up to snuff as get a us version phone from att one thing that i notice after some use which bug me be that the resolution of the attach photos i would send in the message app be very poor blurry and no detail it really tone down the resolution the answer be to change message apps from the stock android to something else i try textra and voila the photo resolution improve immensely problem solve,huawei,1,1,0
348,i really like this phone the feature on this phone be pretty cool i love the phone clone app that allow me to download my call log and text message from my old phone also i have att service and i do not need to call att to activate my phone i just put in the sim card and the phone work i like the feature of the scroll screenshot and the time limit that you can set on screen time the camera on this phone be much better then the camera on my lg stylo 4 i have previously however the camera be not as good as my husband lg g5 set up the fingerprint scanner be easy and fast and i like that it allow me fast access to the phone overall i be give this phone 5 star also as a side note the case and screen protector that be include with the phone and the headphones be not the greatest quality but they be good enough to get you start and hold you over until your case arrive i order a love mei case to go with this phone and it be an excellent fit,huawei,1,1,0

352,i buy two phone to compare one be p30 lite another one pixel 3xl pixel cost around 400 and p30 lite 260290 in my opinion pixel win camera resolution screen google storage google service fyi network test tmobile the biggest disappointment be that p30 lite 4g lte test be 23x less that pixel 3 xl p30 liteon the tmobile network get 48mbps and pixel 3xl around 2025mbps p30 lite not bad phone if you compare phone under 300,huawei,0,0,1
353,false name huawei nova4e lie huawei p30 deceptive behavior,huawei,0,0,1
354,i buy this phone and discover that this particular variant sell do not have 5 ghz wifi support i decide to return it this be a great phone but the lack of 5ghz wifi be a deal breaker you be warn note that i do talk to a amazon customer service person and she confirm that after check with huawei btw the official lx3a model specs appear to list 5ghz wifi support but it appear that variants of this model sell for certain countries like brazil and canada do not have 5ghz capability,huawei,1,1,0

359,love the phone and after have galaxy s6 s7edge s8 s10 i would pick another huawei over a samsung any day i dont have to clean my phone or clear cache nearly as often and never seem to get any type of viruss also the screen be still in tact after 6mos which say a great deal about it as i do construction and it doesnt matter what type case ive have i have break all of my screen i buy a cheap case with this phone and screen protector and have drop it too many time and its be a real trooper i just like everything about the phone better than the samsungs lgs ive have in the past thanx huawei and amazon,huawei,1,1,0
360,i know this be a cheaper version of the p30 pro but come on at least make the wifi good i relalized that their products dont have the ability to connect to 5ghz wifi network they only connect to 24ghz wifi network so if u only have 5ghz network then this might not be that good of a phone the fingerprint reader be indeed pretty quick but the battery life be lack i have their mate 10 and the battery last way longer than this product i think it would be better and last longer but i be wrong overall this be a 6510 phone for its price the camera be not as good as my mate10 pro,huawei,1,1,0

433,at this price point you cant go wrong this be a quality phone without doubt large screen with good color saturation and clarity good sound a plethora of native settings to tweak the phone to suit your visual and performance need this be a not a samsung note 10 but for the feature and performance at a little over 200 this beat the brake off a phone that cost 600 more,huawei,1,1,0

440,love the phone but cant give it 5 star as ive discover its not eligible to register with cloud service when you go to register it it ask your country and usa isnt a choice i call support and they acknowledge that fact and say to transfer my photos etc from my old phone i would have to install the app phone clone on both phone and go from there,huawei,1,1,0

507,i look over a lot of phone look for a replacement age nexus 6 pocophone look good but have questionable carrier compatibility and a lot of other unlock phone in the 300400 range all the budget phone have some serious down side miss some key feature or just a low spec components then i stumble on to the lg v35 and specs be on par with much pricier phone the screen be oled witch i prefer and better than 1080 have expandable memory cameras very good battery hold charge for a long time i be a little worry about lg as have bad experience with nexus 5x in the past but look at the review those issue be resolve i also look at the v40 but not a fan of the notch and it be more money with similar specs so my opinion be this be the best phone for the money right now yes its be release a year ago but compare to current phone in the price range v35 beat them no question it be odd that this phone be not more popular i guess at release 900 price tag scar people and then it fade out of the spotlight what i do not like i be come from a 6 inch phone the older wider screen this screen be a little narrower it be still good size length wise about the same when watch youtube vertically feel like a smaller screen it be a little less bright than my old phone could be a good thing as nexus be too bright at lowest set when use at night come off of stock android i dont like lg and att bloatware and skin the shareware be not a deal breaker nothing that cant be work around but think i mention it so im happy with the purchase and with the better components this phone should last me for a while highly recommend this phone,LG,1,1,0

513,just receive the phone yesterday it look like brand new but the box come not seal everything be okay until i check the camera and try it in the lowlight room and then there s this thing show when i want to take a picture it look like a big purple tint in the leave of the camera it only show when use it near object between 14cm and when the autofocus be work i have find several issue on xda and find out this be some kind of ir laser work for autofocus but mine be worst and it ruin the picture when it show in low light condition i have check the wide lens and find it too but it s just little and hard to notice maybe i get a defective one so i want to return this and give it one more try,LG,0,0,1
514,i will have a small review below this message and my information for tracfonenonatt users below the primary phone review this phone at only 300 be a solid device compare to other midrange phone release in 2019 after 2 weeks of use i can say that this be an excellent choice for people who want the snapdragon 845s performance at a somewhat affordable price lgs os be another bonus feel close to stock android and feel super fast android 9 greatly increase the speed and add nice extra feature but there sadly be no darknight mode to conserve battery the cameras be amaze and get even better when you port google camera over to it the build quality be solid but without a case it be quite a fingerprint magnet sound from bluetooth and the 35mm headphone jack be well above average with loud and clean audio the screen 6 inch display at 2880x1440 resolution look amaze and content from snapchat facebook and instagram look great with accurate color the biggest downside to the device be that the battery isnt very impressive for the price and if battery be a serious concern for you id get a samsung a70 the phone 18w fast charge capabilities help quite a bite with average charge time be around 1 hour and 20 minutes from 0 to 100 overall this phone be excellent and provide high end feature in an affordable midrange package a message to all tracfonenonatt service users this be an att brand phone while it be gsm unlock it still run off of atts network and all phone update android 9 pie and security update all come from att and will not be available until you be on their network this do not mean you need att to get the update but you do need an att compatible sim card from your service providers bring your own phone program to receive them after set up the sim card in the new phone youll need to create an apn to use mobile data at least i need to on tracfone after the phone be fully functional with call text and mobile data you should receive the update within 25 days after activate the phone with your service provider again as long as you buy and activate the phone with an att brand sim card you will receive all available update for your phone my phone take 2 days to receive the update and i have have no problems with tracfones service,LG,1,1,0
515,first of all i want to clear up some stuff about the carrier of this phone the version of the phone that be be sell here be the v35pawm the att unlock version of the phone from what i understand it will work with gsm carriers without modification however i want to use the phone with google fi it be quite easy in this case to flash the phone with the v35oulm kdz find here no urls allow in review but it can be find on the lg firmwares website i use the tutorial on the flash stock roms website to be clear the phone should work with gsm carriers without this process however three be some advantage of flash the kdz no more att bloatware quicker update i have hear that some people use the att software with a different carrier be not get the android 9 update for google fi specifically some feature of the service be not available without use a completely compatible phone flash the oulm software make the phone completely unlock and compatible now about the device itself i buy this to replace a pixel 1 hat have pick up in preparation for an extend trip to europe however the pixel 1 be very buggy and rather outdated the lg v35 have more than effectively replace that phone with the update kdz it actually seem to work better with fi than the picel do and the breadth of options within the os be overwhelm in a positive way the screen resolution can be change along with the way the volume interface work for example another nice touch be lgs theme options i be use a theme call pix color this apply a system wide dark mode and also make the on screen button look like those on the pixel a design that i prefer to lgs however the button can be hide to take advantage of the whole screen retaliate something that can not be do on the pixel devices and some other android phone speak of the screen it be huge and beautiful the pole panel look quite good my only complaint about the phone so far be actually that i think it be a bite too big though i realize that be the current design trend i much prefer the size of the lg g6 that i use to use great phone overall no real complaints so far,LG,1,1,0
516,i have to give my iphone 7 to my son have no desire to spend 1000 or eve 750 for a new flagship phone saw this one at 299 think why not the phone be every bite as good as the review lead me to believe it would be the screen be amaze so much bigger brighter and more dynamic than my old iphones be its fast smooth and have an excellent camera im not really a heavy phone user but i do spend some time every day on duo to video chat with my kid read news feed check email play some light game call text quite a bite and the battery always last the full day unfortunately im have to return the phone simply because its so much bigger than my iphone be once i put a case on it it be just too big too carry around in my work environment if i spend much time watch youtube videos or play graphic intensive game i wouldnt hesitate to keep this phone the screen and processor be that good ill probably just end up play it safe and get a refurbish iphone 7 even though it cost more than this one and have a smaller less vivid lcd screen i would recommend this phone and this seller though without hesitation to anyone in the market for a flagship level phone at a midrange price especially if theyre use to todays phone size range be on the big side,LG,1,1,0
517,what be this device buy from mobileexpress buy use however scratch on the screen where not disclose upfront and the fact that it be an att phone be not disclose either and theres no android 9 update while my friends do receive it usbc to hdmi be not work i cannot recommend such device far less from this seller,LG,1,1,0
518,im quite happy with this phone particularly for the money my most recent previous phone be a samsung galaxy 6 s active then a galaxy 7 active i like both of those phone good feature and very rugged design but after the 7 develop line in the screen twice and samsung wouldnt repair it the second time though its a know issue with that model i decide to bail on them and try something different the v35 have some good point fast charge with qi capability real headphone jack and expandable memory be the main sell point for me its definitely an att phone which im ok with as im with att and will be in the foreseeable future with my wifes corporate discount i get 5g connectivity in most of the part of chicago i frequent even surprisingly in the downtown subway the wifi call work well which it didnt with the samsungs the screen be fine good color and resolution i rarely watch any video on it but when i have its be ok the speaker be pretty wimpy i do wish it be louder if the phone be in another room theres a pretty good chance i wont hear it when i have a call or notification the samsungs be definitely louder bluetooth audio be good and work well in my car the camera be ok though the pixel count be similar to my dslr its no contest when you look at the same scene photograph with the two of them no surprise there but it show you pixel count be a bad way to compare digital cameras color accuracy be soso but i dont care all that much as i wont use it for anything important my only real negative be the rear power button fingerprint reader im adapt but would definitely prefer a side power button battery life be ok but not anything special the fast charge offset that somewhat when it get low you can get back up to 100 with a quickness even use the qi charge one thing i do really like be the 2 year warranty if they trust their engineer enough to offer that warranty it make me believe the phone be pretty well construct so overall for the 300 clam it run me im very satisfy and can recommend it as a good value for the money,LG,1,1,0
519,the phone be in fact new and unlock work very well with straight talk remember to punch out the nanosized card and place it in the slot at the front of the sim holder after you get set up with the carrier you will need to google the apn settings for that carrier and manually enter them into the phone a high quality phone at a super price,LG,1,1,0
520,ive have the phone for about 2 weeks now in general i love the phone so far it be unlock and easy to set up on the att service that i have there be preloaded apps but i have be able to remove ones i dont want although i have only remove a couple so im not sure if they be all removablethe only thing im not fond of be the stationary screen to the leave of home but apparently that be become the standard for almost all phone and be something i will get use to the battery life be goodi think it might be better but to be honest i use my phone like a mini computer and play on it a lot no major concern or complaints,LG,1,1,0

523,i accidentally drown my lg v40 need to replace it after do some research i find this to be the best deal at 300 this be a high end phone at midrange price a 800 plus phone do not have much more to justify the price im satisfy with my purchasesuch a underrate phone im with att and all work perfect happy to have android pie 90 for those on another carrier and unable to update to 90why not buy a cheap att pre pay card and update another option would be to borrow a friends att sim card and update,LG,1,1,0

529,the headphone jack just stop work before the phone be a year old the socket be now completely loose headphone jack no longer snap in and the phone will no longer recognize any set of headphones i try to plug in it now only play through the phone speaker i choose this phone for its high quality dac to listen to music at work and when i travel originally i be please with it it use to produce noticeably more clarity than my laptop or previous phone when use the same headphones oppo pm3 and music file i want the phone to last and try to be gentle when plug and unplug the headphones which i would do perhaps 23 time a day on workdays originally the battery would hold its charge for 23 days with bluetooth and wireless enable but very few applications run 9 months later under the same usage it will last less than a day give the strongly seal case the battery do not appear to be replaceable at least by myself perhaps a repair shop can but i have hop to get a longer life then 9 months before the battery begin to degrade so noticeably everything else about the phone be between good and very good the screen be very good the primary camera be okay not great in the dark even with flash i do like that this phone come with fewer bloat apps to disable and remove than my previous samsung phone though it still have quite a few,LG,0,0,1

620,first off like many have note the phone i receive be an att device since i be an att customer it work without issue and i cant say for sure if the phone be unlock or not for those wonder if the phone get android 9 pie yes it doesat least if you be on att the most recent update july 2019 improve battery life significantly what i look for camera image quality both bright and low light processor screen headphone jack camera ive be shoot image for nearly 30years and seldom leave home without my dslrbut when i do id like my phone camera to be able to capture decent amount of detail in various light condition i wouldnt say this be the best camera but it surely hold its own the lowlight mode be a bite slow but its work its magic combine pixels ive attach a few photos all in all id say its performance slot in to the upper midrangelower highend processormemory qualcomm snapdragon 845 previous years highend 6gb ram this combo keep the phone move right along even with android 9photo apps and game alike be snappy screen quadhd 4k oled screen really cant get much better than this no notch true deep blackscolor reproduction be fantasticbut it be dim i crank the screen up to 80 under direct sunlight and its still tough to see headphone jack it matter to me because i enjoy audio as much as i do photography so naturally i love to be able to enjoy my wire akg headphones and with a dedicate dac build into the phone i can definitely say its sound reproduction be by far superior to phone in this price range and higher if use the headphone jack the bad though be that the overall volume it output be on the low side in a noisy room i need the volume to be at a minimum of 50 to hear the music and even higher to be immersive volume through bluetooth be fine all in all im a happy camper with this phone ive be a iphone user since the 6s 7 xrchasing the cameraand now back to android with this lg v35 thinq if performance value and feature be what youre afterthis be the one,LG,1,1,0
621,as my old lgk10 be die i desperately need a new phone at a reasonable price while i be will to buy a new alternate brand of phone outright my carrier would not yield on their push for a monthly finance plan if any of these irritants sound familiar or you just want a great phone this could be a good choice for you i receive a new unlock lg35 thinq phone it arrive in an unseal box with an att logo like the merchandise you buy from the carrier the product contain the phone a plug and power cord an instruction book lens wipe and sim slot pin you do not get a sim card ear bud or a glass protector this phone have triple the storage of the k10 64 vivid color and pixel display and an optional ai photo system for the camera the normal google install basic att apps and lg apps new since my orig lg 10 purchase be also include on the device i dont think it have too much bloatware phone audio be excellent and i notice it be hit both 5g and 4g network the phone be qi enable so the wireless charge could help avoid the bend prung problems that accelerate damage when use wall chargers i have no problems set up my fingerprint reader but this model can also be program for facial recognition voice print traditional passwords or knock pattern att be very helpful in transfer data and contact list etc to the new device my old sim and micro sd fit into the same slot the best point by far be the price this truly be a wonderful deal on a wonderful product upon place my amazon order i even receive a link from the distributor to further product support lg fan should not pass this up,LG,1,1,0
622,i buy this device to activate on straight talk gsm and as advertise this product be unlock atts bloatware be relatively unintrusive and after cleanup it doesnt take up much of the devices internal storage with that say its an excellent phone with few compromise overall the lg v35s build quality be excellent beautiful glass exterior with a stylish design reminiscent of a galaxy s9 it feel great in the hand even with a bulky impact case on the 1440p oled screen be fantastic as well its nearly as good as a samsung panel performancewise this device be quite snappy the snapdragon 845 and 6gb of ram make multitasking a breeze and there be no lag in lgs stock rom at all even with all the apps i have instal the lte modem deliver outstanding performance as do the wifi modem ive never be able to get 70mbps download over lte in my back yard but now i can the camera be great as well the rear cameras take great still shots and the front camera be more than adequate for snapchat video be also quite good the image be very vivid and crisp battery life be acceptable and it isnt really a problem if you have the include fast charge brick on hand audio be also pretty good it come with a highquality dac for 35mm headphone audio playback which sound excellent the mono speaker be decent for voice call and talk show but be pretty shrill for music it do come with attspecific feature like visual voicemail voice over lte and wifi call but i have yet to get them work on straight talk my only concern be software update the include software be pretty good but the security patch only reach november 2018 and lg be notorious for be slow with software update if you absolutely need up to date security patch beware i would normally expect a phone like this to cost 700 and even then its a reasonable price especially if youre an att customer however its only 350 and it be an excellent deal would recommend,LG,1,1,0
623,i have cricket service and it work perfectly,LG,1,1,0
624,i want to upgrade my lg v20 on tmobiles network but didnt want to pay 800 or lock myself into a 2year contract so i be look at cheap phone i come close to buy a renewedused essential or similar for 150 but then come across the att unlock v35 thinq i be very worry about use an att phone on tmobile but figure id try it im so glad i pull the trigger after receive the phone i realize i may not be able to get update as im not on atts network i then notice this phone be an official googlefi phone which should mean its 100 compatible with tmobile and should also allow me to get update it be easy to use the lg software to update the phone to the latest firmware for googlefi list as gfi on lgs website leave me with a debloated os that will allow me to obtain future update as far as use the googlefi on tmobiles network it work perfect the phone hardware have the same band as the v20 so i wasnt expect to get the 600mhz band im get at least as good reception as my v20 and speed test be perfectly fine 140mb in some case ive be hype this to everyone i know who might want a new phone and may be on tmobile att or googlefi yes its not a 2019 phone with the latest band but its easily better then many phone and be very much overlook in 2018,LG,1,1,0
625,i order this phone as a new unlock gsm phone i recieved an email from the seller before the phone arrive about contact them for an unlock code if need when try to activate on my network ive buy unlock phone for years and never have to input any code to make it work they assure me that the phone be new though i get the phone insert my sim card and power up to an att logo along with the standard att bloatware im on cricket so its the same network and the data and call work after a little while play with the phone i notice that on a bright white background the center third of the screen look dingyyellow brown i do some research and find no relate issue to this particular phone but some problems with other oled screen have ugly white i change the screen tone and it be a little better several hours later after play an online game with my son i set the phone down on the table and it sound like a thin piece of plastic i look and find the the back upper leave corner of the glass be pull away from the frame of the phone with a very noticeable gap i could see glue residue where it should be seal at that be the final straw i immediately start the return on amazon swap my sim card back to my old phone box it up and send it back the next day the phone be very smooth it take good picture and play game at the highest resolution and frame rate this particular phone do not come close to the quality i expect after read so many great review a couple of days later i find this same phone through cricket for 299 i go to the store and put my hand on the last one instock the screen be excellent with clean bright white and no sign of the back come loose from the frame i buy the phone and have enjoy it since i also find that the phone cricket be sell be truely unlock it doesnt even have cricket logo on start and the only bloatwear be from lg i recommend this phone but be careful where you buy it from,LG,0,0,1
626,i seriously love this phone i have a samsung galaxy s 5 and it fi ally bite the dust i want an android and my dad reccomended an lg the review on this i e be goodi spend more than i have origionally plan but everyone say great phone for 350 which when i dont have to make payments on a phone be actually a good pricethey werent wrong im not use to the speed or the capacity of what it can do i have be use the battery a lot just caise i cant put it down the only thibg i dont love be i couldnt immediatly figure out how to turn off the data and use my wifi insteadbut once i figure that out the next day i havent have issue also it take a nano sim card so i litterally go to att with old and new phone and they take care of sim card and phone transfer all do in 10 min be happy im just sad i waoted so long to make the switch,LG,1,1,0
627,why do i like this phone after 48 hours here be my impression this thing be fast every app load virtually instantly connect very quickly its build for att network and connect better to their network than any phone i have try what really set this apart too be the sound quality the eq process for car audio be awesome lot of control over the surround channel bass etc with headphones its even better it feel like a premium phone in the hand symmetrical and elegant and no notch this phone seem more support by lg than others several patch up to and through android 9 pie camera quality be above average it beat my friends samsung s7 edge quite nicely which beat by previous lg g5 299 be price cant get a better deal imo,LG,1,1,0
628,i have contact my carrier safelink wireless its program with an att phone number though numerous time and have receive and instal 2 new sim card and still cannot get wifi call to enable i be tell by both safelink and att that these phone be lock to att and the only way to get wifi call to work be you have to get your service directly from att so they can lock your phone number into their service and not any other carrier like safelink net10 or tmobile it will not work even though i have an att phone number when i call up att and even go in to an att store they tell me that they cant locate my account because im not directly with them and that my service account be with safelink this stink i either have to stay with safelink and forgo wifi call or cancel my service and setup new service directly with att at a higher monthly fee just to enable wifi call other than that the phone itself be great its quick fingerprint sensor work great facial recognition also work very quick i be even able to upgrade to oreo 90 the only other downside to this phone be the battery life my old phone be a blu vivo 8 and the battery in that phone would last up to 2 days with the v35 use the same apps in the same manner as the old vivo 8 this v35 last if im lucky maybe 1 day screen display be great camera take wonderful picture and videos sound be so so with only one speaker its much faster and the screen be much better than my vivo 8 with no notch at the top of the screen i even instal a 256mb microsd card into the available slot to store pictsvideos and most apps to free up process speed for the price its a great phone,LG,0,0,1
629,a great phone at an excellent price with excellent feature such as light weight dimension oled display ram and the battery i buy this phone to use it outside the usa the gsm be unlock and everything work fine i just have to configure the apn for my local network as discuss in other review originally the operate system come with version 8 i try to update it to version 9 by myself but i use a ulm kdz firmware and it be not compatible with the phone version since this be a v35awm10w so i have to contact a specialist who be able to flash the firmware to v350awm20d and update the phone to android 9 pie,LG,1,1,0
630,i be very satisfy with this purchase i have always use an iphone and finally make the decision to switch to an android i be not disappoint this phone be awesome it be fast and take really great picture sometimes when use certain apps i have to press slightly more on the screen in order for it to pick up this seem to happen with facebook mostly so could just be the app portrait mode on the camera be amaze crystal clear image that almost look professional the phone doesnt have a lot of memory but you be able to import a micro sd if need the sound quality on this phone be great too i dont really need a speaker anymore its also waterproof which be a huge plus when have children for 400 which be half the price of a galaxy you get a great deal and value out of this phone remember though that this phone will only work with carriers like cricket and att not verizon or sprint i recommend this phone 100,LG,1,1,0
631,i move to this phone from a galaxy s8 it be a great value for the cost my galaxy s8 be work fine but the screen have crack badly and be entirely too much money to fix i be look for something decent for less than the cost of repair so i stumble upon this gem of a phone on amazon first i like the screen size ratio it be wider than the galaxy and i like the display better like that it also feel nice in my hand second the repair cost be super reasonable i have this phone 2 weeks and crack the screen repair cost be 146 and be complete quickly and it look and felt like a new phone when i get it back this phone also have a 2 year warranty vs the others 1 year this phone do task fast and have a great camera,LG,1,1,0
632,as other review have state this be not an unlock phone this be an att phone there be no instructions on how to get the phone unlock the phone i receive appear new for the price i wont complain too much the phone itself be nice and have nicer feature than the phone i be look to get at about the same price moto g7 i purchase this phone after have a g5 plus i as many other people im sure refuse to purchase a phone for 600 the 350 i pay be ok,LG,1,1,0
633,no sim card with phone package say there be a sim card when i try to get technical support i get the run around with the program to have them return my phone call very frustrate cant make a complete review without sim card,LG,0,0,1
634,this phone be replace the lg v20 that i love for years a little smaller but a powerhouse of a phone have it for a few days and love it im use it on cricket wireless ans no problems what so ever,LG,1,1,0
635,i be on the market for an s9 but saw this phone for almost half the price but with the same specs it be a no brainer of a purchase and after have it for a week im glad i find this steal the screen be great the phone be snappy and responsive i havent mess around with the camera too much but base on professional review its solid the fingerprint reader be snappy my phone battery easily last a day on above average usage the device be waterproof the design be please and feel good to hold in the hand feel solid after a week of usage i have have no real complaints regard this device if youre on the market for a 2019 android flagship phone you cant pass on this deal not at this price for those worry about the unlock nature of the phone yes it be an unlock att phone but trust me that doesnt matter just disable the att apps and boom youll be fine i cant speak for its functionality on other us carriers but i be from jamaica and it work perfectly on our digicel network,LG,1,1,0
636,i havent have my phone that long but i havent find anything i dont like about it i dont use the fingerprint reader but that be personal preference the camera take very good quality picture and the screen resolution be super ive only have this phone for 1 week but i would highly recommend it,LG,1,1,0
637,beautiful phone to bring to metro easy to switch over from att possession long as you input your previous metro phone info name apn mmsc mcc mnc apn type do not enter anything here apn protocol apn name protocol into your network settings so you can connect data to metro provide internet also youll need to disable uninstall a few att bits imcluded in this unlock but not lg stock item much simpler than it sound call metropcs theyll get you start whole setup take me about 3 hours much of it update and download apps figure out what work be relatively easy i now have a wonderful new better phone at the 300 price point yea for me,LG,1,1,0
638,im afraid i have to give a 3 star for false advertise because it say it come unlock but the phone be still lock,LG,0,0,1
639,phone work great and despite the att brand at startup it operate on my mvno just fine for the price you just cant beat all the feature this phone have though for a 300 phone this will blow the competition away in any sidebyside comparison sidenote because the phone be unlock it will not receive the android 9pie update,LG,1,1,0
640,move from lg v10 to v35 v10 be still work good but i need an upgrade once you use lg product and if you be loyal then its hard to look for other options i receive my package early securely and inside amazons box i find this brand new uncut seal new devise make me happy the reason i go with v35 because i hate those notch i be wait for lg to go full screen 90 screen to body ratio but that time i be happy with the oled screen clarity sound quality via dac and this be definitely an improvement for me over v10 i be good for another 3 years for sure,LG,1,1,0
641,this phone as just about all the flagship specs you could want the camera be very good and comparable to the galaxay s9 the screen be fantastic oled display in all reality most people just surf the web and text so you dont need the latest processor for that in addition the camera bump from year to year doesnt justify for me spend 7001k for an entirely new phone thats picture quality well better be not league better so this phone should be all you need for the next 15 2 years easy in addition im able to use the hotspot and wifi call that others be say they cant do im use it on tmobile i simply take it to tmobile and tell them to set the apn set up once that be do i test out both feature and use the hotspot daily,LG,1,1,0
642,the phone have all the feature i want lot of att extras on the phone i get rid of what i could i have cricket wireless as my service provider and the phone work great as of now the only thing i do not like be the battery life i have do everything possible to extend the life yesterday it be barely use and by the afternoon it be at 50 and that be with the option to be in the extend battery life mode i be go to continue to investigate what else i can do regard this problem,LG,1,1,0

646,description lead me to believe this be a factory unlock phone since att isnt list anywhere on the page however it be att unlock 2 star because it do work with google fiwith the exception of all the fi network extras the i expect to work with a factory unlock version of the phone really consider send it back though and get a real fi compatible phone,LG,0,0,1

751,before i start my review i would like to mention that my previous phone be the iphone 5 samsung galaxy s7 and a samsung galaxy s9 i will use the galaxy s9 for a couple of examples since it s the last phone i have and my wife still have hers alright hold on tight for this one because i get inspire lol pros screen the first thing that with catch your attention be the screen this screen be colorful sharp bright and very attractive to the eye it have a feature i ve never see on any other phone where it can boost the screen brightness at a very high level so its easy to use when on direct sunlight also its flat which mean no weird edge screen like the galaxy s9 this mean no screen glare on the corner and temper glass screen protectors be compatible camera the camera be very impressive with nice color enhancements the coolest feature be the wideangle lens its not a fisheye like the gopro but it let you take incredible photos from a very close distance battery yeah i have no idea why people complain about the battery of this phone maybe be because they pay too much attention to the hardware the truth be the phone last the entire day with absolutely no problem i feel the battery performance be as good if not better than the galaxy s9 face recognition the face recognition be fast very fast you don t have to find the perfect angle or wait for it to unlock i find it to unlock in 1 second or less sound the sound its loud clear but when place on a table it have no competition it really beat the phone out there con camera although the camera in general way better than the samsung galaxy s9 night photography front camera with the s9 turn out to be slightly better this be because the s9 have double aperture side button this phone include an extra button that activate google now i do not use google now so it would be nice to be able to use this button as another shortcut such as camera email or any other thing,LG,1,1,0
752,the phone in and of it self be a good phone however its not the us version g710ulm with a us warranty as advertise 3819 its the international version g710em with no available us warranty one way to tell if youve be rip off be to check the model number in settingsabout phone if you have any other number other than g710ulm you dont have the us version with a warranty if a time come when you need warranty service you be sorry out of luck i contact lg directly provide lg with the imei number for the phone and they confirm the phone be intend only for in the uk not for in the usa lg also confirm you cannot get a us warranty for it another way to tell if youve be rip off be to power off the phone and power it back on if you see claro and word in another language youve be rip off claro be a carrier in guatemala and be what the phone i receive boot up with additionally the phone have claro bloatware instal on it of which couldnt be uninstalled additionally there be compatibility issue with this phone for us carriers because its an international version not a us version i have att and theyve inform me phone call should work but there may be very slow data speed because of network conflict with the international version i confirm this with a data speed test and my data speed be very inconsistant and very slow,LG,0,0,1
753,so i buy this at bh with a big discount it list 120 less than this one but it come with several freebies that make the phone cost around 530ish txsh be include you get a temper glass screen protector and you get a pair of earbuds with mic now the phone i check this out at t mobile and be stun by the screen love the 1959 ratio it make the phone bigger than my old one without make it too big it still have to fit in my front pocket screen be so nice and android 8 be nice the two things i look for in a phone besides call text and email be for photos and music camera be very good with latest update its better than the iphone 7 maybe not the very best but if you aren t a youtube reviewer you win t be compare it to 10 other phone take some videos and really like them cool feature be you can pause the video but keep it as one video file just with break it also have separate camera and video record button just like my digital camera no fumble with a menu to switch between photo and video low light be good wide angle be really nice for indoor shots music be a priority to me i listen to music thru my car speakers all the time i also need a headphone jack to do this so that really limit my choices i m so glad lg keep the jack the quad dac be awesome it do make the music sound better even my car speakers boom box be nice the speaker be very loud probably the loudest you can get bass be absent until you place it on a table mids and highs be just fine overall this be perfect for me no mess with itunes i hate itunes so much i will never buy an iphone all i want to do be add music effortlessly really just love everything about the phone 2 month update the extend battery option definitely help with battery life i m a light to medium user so i often go two days before charge fast charge really be fast it charge 1 per minute google assistant be actually really cool when it work i really didn t know what this be all about but be find that i use it a lot now it s just like alexa which i use all the time at home so use this isn t hard to get use to the lg g7 have an always on listen mic so you just say hey google most will complain about the lg skin on top of android i actually like some of the feature the float bar be useful and i use it everyday i use the lg music player because google music player be just an ad machine no matter what set i set google music will eventually start push its pay service and music i have no interest in super bright boost screen be actually useful in broad daylight while wear sunglasses i can keep my sunglasses on and still see my screen i ve use boost more often than i think i ever would so many unlock methods it s ridiculous i use in this order face unlock fingerprint unlock knock code voice unlock i be find that i wish the fingerprint unlock be in the screen instead of behind as a phone the size be really nice thin kind of heavy and long it remind me of hold a home phone when hold it up to my ear the mic extend all the way to my mouth it feel natural and not like a small toy the way most phone feel after several update the camera be amaze some of the best photos i ve see with latest update photos be now better than the iphone 7 i now use my phone for all photos and videos and no longer use my digital camera the quality be better and overall experience be better faster and easier than my canon love this phone,LG,1,1,0
754,i receive my platinum grey lg g7 thinq in the mail yesterday i buy a case and screen protector and everything set up all my information and transfer my contact then i go to the store today to put it on a data plan and the verizon gentleman tell me it be not compatible dont believe the answer question by the manufacturer that say its compatible with verizon it be not i repeat it be not compatible with verizon also i be play around with the camera last night and the picture really leave more to be desire for have one of the highest mp cameras on a phone the quality be subpar if a great camera be something that you want try a different phone my friend have a google pixel 3 and it take amaze picture effortlessly other than that the phone meet functionality expectations which be the only reason why it didnt get a 1 im mostly rat it low because this seller be bs and i dont want them to lie anymore on their description and question when theyre ask which network this phone be compatible with,LG,0,0,1

758,i love the 2 full days i can go without a recharge and spend 3 to 4 hours a day use the phone if youve get the money for this phone its a wise choice it use both gsm and cdma band just depend on the sim card you put in it as ive have both type of sim card instal i would have prefer that the back come off or they would have send the key to open the tray for replace the sim card and the external storage for the price you pay it should be include but instead i have to order the sim card key from amazon too,LG,1,1,0

779,last year lg make a big deal about how they be go to update their phone in a timely manner this could not be further from the truth here we be in q2 of 2019 and this phone be still on android 8 not even 81 come from a pure android before that get update within a few months this be a huge disappointment lg android customizations be more annoy than useful and hardly outweigh the new feature that android 9 have i would gladly go to a stock android os if it mean they could roll out an update in a timely manner lg spend all of their resources make new phone who else have 2 flagship phone at the same time that be so similar its difficult to tell them apart instead of update the phone they have and wonder why their mobile devision be fail,LG,0,0,1
780,i be no stranger to smart phone and have be both an android and an iphone user i avoid samsung because i felt they have become bloat and overprice and i want a cheaper phone that share many samsung specs so i end up with the lg g7 which turn out to be one of the most disappoint phone ever here be the dissapointments in order 1 the battery life drain very quickly even though it speed charge i don t always have access or time 2 the photo quality terribly disappoint and worse than my 7 year old note 3 that i still own massively digress here not only poor quality but photo do funky things like refuse to focus on closeups and doc scan 3 fingerprint sensor fail lg say to factory reset the phone which do not help now i cannot login to my phone or appsaccounts with fingerprint scan 4 phone become very sluggish especially when unlock take a few to start 5 phone do not have as good of reception on same service as prior phone 6 the screen remain on the entire time on a call try to turn it off in usual manner power button press disconnect the call 7 the sim micro sd card tray be too small and take great effort to get either one in without them pop out again update literally within a week of post this review the phone completely quit work cannot hard reset cannot do anything ive contact lg warranty since i buy this as a brand new phone but unless you buy from best buy or other authorize retailer you be out of luck complete dud see the photo i literally get a question mark on the screen when try to turn it on and that be it nevermore lg you have be screw people since 2015 when your flagship phone the g4 have bootloop issue force users to seek service center so they can get their devices run again,LG,0,0,1
781,i recently secure a new job and after accept it realize rather suddenly that im go to have to return my current samsung s8 and ill need another device i wasnt able to get into what i really want the note 9 but i do some research and decide to go with the g7 the name thinq be a bite of silly name if you ask me but oh well my last lg phone be the g3 which i genuinely like i wasnt eligible for the g4 upgrade and when the g5 modular phone come out i have make a firm decision not to get it at all as do most of you i go with the galaxy s6 then the s7 edge the s8 and i be firmly entrench within the samsung ecoverse and fully expect another one be in my future but that be not to be as i mention i do my research and decide to go with the g7 for my budget it be not just the best phone option but also probably the best phone available for that price it have the internals of the more expensive samsung rival except only 4gb ram instead of 6 in the s9 the screen be almost the exact same size and that within a smaller frame not a bad tradeoff if you ask me i be a bite disappoint that lg hadnt fall in line and upgrade to an oled screen like even apple have but i must say that whatever lg be do well keep do it because the screen be genuinely fantastic lcd or oled this screen be vivid and amaze it can get ridiculously bright which make the screen easily readable in virtually any light honestly i cannot see the difference between it and the super amoled screen on my s8 if im be honest i almost decide not to go with the lg for the lcd screen alone but im glad i choose to give it a shoot anyway lg hit a home run with the g7 screen stun and beautiful the one place where oled beat the lg however be in the deep black and how easily it be to save battery life by switch to a screen with more solid black not an option here but dang this screen shouldnt stop you from consider get the g7 like it do me initially the build be top notchbut that only mean in order to support wireless charge it will have to be a bite more vulnerable than phone with all metal back its a tradeoff but worth it if you know the convenience of wireless charge trust me solve this issue by get a good case that allow for wireless charge and youll be set an honesttogoodness 35mm headphone jack right when many be get rid of themits a bold move but one i certainly appreciate the quad dac audio player be especially for a mobile phone just plain amaze youre go to hear better audio with this phone especially with earbuds and headphones than you will with arguably any mobile device out there i love mine its almost worth buy for this alone a lot have be make of the cameras and i find them to be pretty dang good i dont think youre go to find much to scream about but in my opinion i find them to be on par with my samsung i havent experiment much with it yet but i will and may do a quick update here before too long the boom speakerhmmm a bite more underwhelming than i expect especially consider how much lg brag about it while it certainly get much louder than my s8 and i truly appreciate that be it loud enough that youd consider use it to watch a movie uhhh no at least i sure wouldnt music sound better but just not anywhere as good as i expect consider what i read and saw for the g7 market usbc charge another welcome addition along with fast charge and wireless charge too once i get use to both of these feature im tell you it be quite difficult to go back to something that do not offer this as a standard feature the multiple ways to unlock the phone be pretty impressive you have your standard fingerprint sensor which be just about a perfect placement since that be where your finger rest naturally most of the time anyway and wasnt lg the first to employ this feature in the first place you can opt for use a pattern or code or even facial recognition which i find to be much better than my s8 and along with that much faster it be so unreliable that i turn it off entirely on the s8 gorilla glass 5 on front and back i read elsewhere that they use gg 4 on back and 3 on front but i just confirm at lgs own site that be incorrect help make this very vulnerable look phone more protect than it looksbut with that say i still recommend a good case and screen protector i much prefer glass over the older silicone ones regardless of how careful you may be it isnt a question of if but when you will accidentally drop it and then youll find out just how accurate their claim be regard how tough it may be why take that chance even if you be super careful it may be someone else handle your device who drop itthe point be do yourself a favor and take care of it speedwhile it wasnt a huge step up from what i notice with my s8 i do notice how smooth it seem to be and how much less lgs skin seem intrusive than it do back when i have the g3 i think this be a move in the right direction any time you can bring a device closer to stock android be a better move lg seem to always be in samsungs shadow and therefore try to take its own spin on things and the g7 be no exception samsung have some fantastic theme that be exclusive to their devices and i find out the other day the g7 have some to choose from as well nowhere near as many mind you but some be actually pretty decentbut id sacrifice it all for stock android and finallythat notch ever since the iphone x come out with that notch it seem that you either be okay with it or you hat it not many in betweeners say what you want about it but if you want more screen real estate you have 2 options either place the camera somewhere other than on the front of the screen some have a novel mechanical popup camera or you place it on front and work around it somehow lg embrace this and you have the option of get rid of it or keep it i find that for most things it simply doesnt bother me which i find to be a surprise consider before i get it i really think it would bug me silly but nope you may be different however which be why the option to remove it entirely be a nice touch the dedicate google now button be an almost direct ripoff of samsungs bixby buttonexcept that google now be actually useful unlike bixby which most users simply turn off it can do almost anything google can dojust a whole lot slower sure it have a few feature that google now and siri cannot do but they be so slow you may as well just do it by hand yourself the other issue be that like bixby this button activate google and nothing else you cannot remap it to open other things that may also be super convenient for you like say the camera or the phone etc lg if you want to take a leap ahead of samsung youre go to need to have the courage to make the decisions that samsung refuse to do just sayin all in all a very underrate phone that may be hamper a bite due to lgs inability to market their devices with any kind of genuine successwhich be too bad this phone be exceptional and the equal to almost any device out there today,LG,1,1,0
782,purchase through verizon not amazon but be very happy with this phone it replace my droid turbo 2 i do a lot of research first and be happy i do its quick have a great quality screen take nice pics even in low light and be very customizable and user friendly glad it still have a headphone jack and sd slot battery life be not unbelievable but it seem comparable with all the other major model out there now also sound quality be a little disappoint the loud end really lose quality and sound tinny but overall i would recommend to a friend and would purchase again myself,LG,1,1,0
783,the phone i receive be not compatible with sprint or verizon network lg distribute some factory unlock phone directly and some through brightpoint and the ones that come from brightpoint be only compatible with a select few carriers which do not include sprint or verizon on the box the model number be list as lmg710ulmbptpl this model use different lte and cdma band that do not work with most us carriers lg really should list these model separately i spend nearly two hours on the phone with amazon lg and sprint try to get this phone to activate and it be not possible because this phone be not compatible,LG,0,0,1
784,a 6000 mah power bank battery be absolutely necessary if you be away from a power source for more than 4 hours when im play game the battery rarely last over 4 hours if you be play or watch show in bright daylight the battery will be deplete within 25 hours photos be above average with good low light performance and excellent daylight performance backlit image be wash out and just terrible auto focus be weak so you have to manually touch the screen before most shots that say i love that i be able to buy a phone with a snapdragon 845 processor and 4 gigs of memory for under 400 elsewhere those be flagship specs as of early 2019 the longer screen mean you lose a lot of horizontal real estate compare to other 6 inch phone but it help you enjoy movies shoot in 169 ratio the screen on boost mode be bright enough for direct daylight even with polarize sunglasses the waterproof rat allow it to be take on snorkel trip as well as into the shower ive never have a single program run slowly in the 6 months since i buy it passmark benchmarks put it at the top 90 of phone in the market i would recommend this if you be on a budget and dont mind 2x or 3x a day recharge fortunately as long as you have a 2 amp or faster charger this phone fully charge within 60 minutes 1a charge port require at least 3 hours,LG,0,0,1
785,get mine use it didnt come with any accessories but i have find no blemish i can buy accessories xd anyway my biggest complaint be its still on android 8 oreo cmon lg and this be on google fi its fully endorse by google i do not expect that android 9 should come but android 10 be out so cmon lg worst support ever for a flagship device 169 videos understandably dont fill the 189 screen i dont know what i be expect the camera though not something i know much about be really not that great word be due to software overhead android 9 where be you but the one shoot i take be so blurry if i really care though i could find a better app to use and so on but default it suck i hear it get pretty good though ok it might be a little unresponsive of a touchscreen too ive notice on my tappy tap tap game it sometimes take 3 or 4 tap to find the hotspot i mean maybe its me but my history with lg be like this so it could be the software i will update when i mod the phone if it be actually a thing also part be cuz im not use to such a small bezel like where do the screen end so i could be touch the bezel thats a short set of negative on a 300 dollar 400 new phone though pluses include widescreen camera not that i care about that but it seem to be all the rage a boomin speaker just 1 speaker mind you but i can hear it in the shower without bring it into the actual shower that be loud thats basically a bluetooth speaker quad dac that make my 50 100 ohm yamahas sound like 500 bose overprice but hey you get the idea bose headphones be better quality than their speakers though super bright screen i can see outside and a great 5 hour screen on time basically all day battery so with it be super affordable with plus specs and google certify though slow update i believe they will come eventually i count 3 negs not count the aspect ratio one thats an android issue really to 5 positives highly recomended,LG,0,0,1

792,i have now have two experience with them that be both around their horrible design for sim card handle on the g6 they have such a flimsy sim card tray that they routinely break and often that be inside the phonedamaging contact as you try to pull the mangle tray out do a quick search and you will see how many vendors offer replacement trays and how many users be screw by the thing break inside the phone that be then your problem because it be physical damage and be not cover by their warranty program add to that the repair policy of it take 2 weeks to turn your repair around so yu have no phone and the result be i will never buy another lg phone and i strongly suggest you also avoid their products,LG,0,0,1
793,do not preform like a phone of this spec should the battery life be absolutely abhorrent the fingerprint sensor be slow and very inconsistent and the software experience be very buggy the camera app be constantly crash the normal camera have a very narrow field of view but can take good picture the wide angle camera be of horrible quality the selfie camera be awful snapchat videos and picture be laggy frame rate drop mess and try to watch videos be a constant drag and buffer freeze disaster and its not internet relate i have other devices on the same source that play the same video flawlessly its just this phone its awful no screen protector fit it right either and the mono bottom fire speaker be trash phone call be super quiet even on max volume this phone be awful,LG,0,0,1
794,receive the phone unlock and new as promise however there be still other issue you cant update the phone outside of att network because this phone be still new in its box its on an old android 8 version if you want to update the phone you need to connect to the att network with an att sim lg and att have design it this way you wont be able to update it any other way and the bootloader be lock supposedly it be possible to flash other firmwares onto the phone but of course this isnt support by lg to do this i have to obtain a att sim from walmart 10 at walmart 5 from att and a prepay card you can use a 10 prepay card but i find out they allow you to activate a singleday plan for only 2 that cost me 20 although it should be possible to do for 7 either way its stupid that i have to go through this just to update the phone shame on you att and to lg for go along with it anyways about the phone itself this phone be at least 1 year old with a nonremovable battery after charge it a few time and measure it with accubattery the battery have lose 10 of its health effectively make it a 3000mah battery aside from that this be an amaze phone its easily one of the best value for the price the oled screen be beautiful it make me want to rewatch everything ive ever see use this screen it play all of the game i use to play on my v20 but with higher settings and be very smooth the design be meh i hate that every manufacturer feel the need to copy apples decisions nobody feel that they could stick to their gun or try to make a unique design motorolas new flipphone look pretty neat though i really with it be closer to the v20 in design or some of the old htc phone but overall the phone be really great the sad thing be this be the best highend value phone lg currently have the v20 and v30 be still good if youre fine with their age the v40 a new v40 gsm version cost over 600 cdma version be 330 if youre will to switch and be basically the same phone but with 3 cameras instead of 2 the g7 an ips screen and only 4gb ram for the same price its just not worth it especially now that ive experience the oled screen i cant go back the difference between these two phone be ridiculous consider these phone release only one month apart from each other the v35 be basically a really hasty correction to the g7 when lg realize they release a subpar phone the g8 hardwarewise the g8 be a slight upgrade with snapdragon 855vs845 128gb and an extra camera its about 180 more than the v35 though use ones be at 320340 if youre will to accept the risk then it might be worth it if only the v35 wasnt so tie to att i believe it would be much more popular as a 300 phone,LG,0,0,1

796,i have complete remove and update my review on this phone and update my rat from four to five star this phone be brand new i be concern because of the seller list these phone under a dozen different seller name that be all the same company and many reviewers complain that they receive a use phone i suspect they unknowingly order a usedrenewed phone or possibly inventory get mix up when the seller ship them to amazon if you order new and get use just send it back for replacement mine be seal in the att box and come with everything expect while wait for my number to be port to att i hook up to my wifi and that take no effort at all i go through uninstalling or disable apps and game i don t want and customize the phone settings and home screen to my like i be prepare to restore my data from a backup on my sd card but find that it be unnecessary instead i instal att mobile transfer on my old phone and use the setup and transfer app on the thinq i easily transfer all my data over to the new phone via wifi any apps i have instal be of course update with google play i immediately notice that the phone be blaze fast compare to my old lg stylo 2 but maybe that isn t say much i miss my stylus i haven t put it through any real stress test yet but i do fully charge the battery and then start stream a movie i keep check the battery and it seem fix at 99 i didn t watch to long but my old stylo 2 drain like a bathtub when stream a movie use lg airdrive on the phone and lg bridge on my laptop i could easily browse file on my phone and transfer things to and from the laptop such as photos music and movies be there anything that isn t easy with this phone well the bio metric sensor can exercise your patience it doesnt seem to have to many issue read finger print once its learn them teach it i find to be rather tedious i probably saw the sensor need to be clean a thousand time i clean the sensor i scrub my hand eventually i be able to get five finger learn nice to have backups the manual state there will be an issue if you have a scar its not kid i have a scar right down the center of the pad of my leave index finger and the sensor have a heck of a time learn it however once it learn any of my print include the scar finger they all do unlock the phone but not with consistency sometimes one touch and the phone be unlock other time i touch each finger that the phone have learn and none of them unlock the phone so i have to go to the secondary method i choose ill work on it wifi call do work i test on my home internet which be pretty lousy and the call keep break up but thats my internets issue not the phone i see no reason to use wifi with my unlimited plan anyway i guess if im in an area where there be no cell service it might come in handy but odds be that if there be no cell service it be unlikely that any wifi will be nearby hotspot work like a charm as well i hook both my laptop and tv up with no issue download speed be only about 5mb but when my internet be down or we have a power outage its better than nothing once my phone number be port over to att i make some call they hear me fine and i hear them fine the phone handle stream from amazon prime with fly color i keep hear about the great sound on this phone i wasnt impress but who doesnt use bud when listen to music anyway this do come with android 8 repeat attempt to update to 9 fail the phone tell me the software be up to date last update say never update att do release 9 for the v35 months ago and att be my providercarrier not cricket or any other mvno i seriously consider go to the att store to have the update manually do but i live outside of town so i plan my trip to town when i have several reason to go i never get that far i have start my prepay promotional plan with att and pay upfront for a year of service five days later att bill me a second time i do call att and work out the issue but something else happen at this point i make my daily attempt to update my phone software and lo and behold it start update my phone come with v350awm10w the update skip 12a and update to 12e i update again and get 12j the next update skip 12k and update to 20b i now have android 9 i do another update to 20c and one last update to v350awm20d that s the most current software i suspect i just have to wait for att to properly put my new phone in the system when they do that they erroneously charge me again but i fix that so apparently in order to get the update you just need to be patient not my forte i do notice that when the phone be sit on my wireless charger during update the phone get pretty warm it do not get warm do update when not on the charger i dont know why i mention lg bridge earlier install on your pc it work just fine and make it extremely easy to move file to and from the phone it supposedly can be use for software update by connect your phone to your computer with a usb cable but i try during my marathon update and it wouldn t work so i just do all the update from my phone lg bridge connect to your phone use your phone lg airdrive too air drive isn t exactly an app you find it in your settings under network this give you access to the file on your phone like songs and picture which you can just grab and drop onto your pc lg bridge also connect to your v35 via usb cable to perform backups which will be keep on your pc of coourse i check out my phone online and find that it be manufacture october 2018 and leave the factory december 2018 it apparently sit on the shelf until i buy it which explain why it be so far behind in update i have absolutely no complaint with this brand new phone it s clean it s fast everything work flawlessly except maybe that bio metric reader when stick your fingerprint on there but i doubt thats something unique to this phone its just something ill need to work on i believe my issue be with my dry hand and finger my only two issue be att issue double bill and wait for the software update to android 9 i think this deal be to good to be true and i would have lot of problems and be dissatisfy with the phone but it turn out to be a great deal on a great phone i couldn t have make a better decision make this purchase i say you should take the plunge and purchase this phone because you will get a brand new phone that work great its be sell at a great price so you should get one before theyre go,LG,1,1,0

801,i have be eye between this and the v40 thinq the battery be slightly better than the v40 but the v40 be more powerful in term of performance of run apps in my opinion its also really bright at max brightness compare to the v40 my eye be just blind by light i buy this phone last week and im only go to use it as a 2nd device for music or play mobile game which so far mobile game load up almost 50 faster on the v35 than the v40 however theres a drop due to the graphics settings depend on the app i still need to wait on the case for the v35 because the phone be about 13 thinner than the v40 my other complaint on the v35 be the fact the fingerprint reader be also the power key which i feel be really impractical its like find a house thats only hold in the middle of the air by a single staircase so id only use the fingerprint scanner as the power key overall though its a pretty neat phone but good lord its really sleek enough to slip off my hand if im not careful a sturdy case be definitely recommend,LG,1,1,0
802,i have have the lg g5 for many years but drop it recently and break the screen so i think id rather upgrade my g5 be completely virgin no bloatware just pristine android phone that i buy on amazon for 250 several years ago it be completely unlock and since i travel to europe a lot i always use local eu sims and g5 always work like a charm include tether which i use a lot to connect my laptop to my phone so the lg v35 thinq be an awesome phone i love it until i start test the functionality that i must have it work out of the box on my cricket wireless sim it also by default enable wifi call on cricket wireless however it would not up allow me to even start tether unless i have an att sim this be really shock shame on att on block basic andriod functionality by instal their rom and block builtin android feature so sadly i end up return the phone if someones figure out how to get tether work without att sim card please let me know i dont mind blow away all the bloatware from att just once and for all however i must have tether work for the phone to be useful to me its a shame that att be so cheap and rip off customers otherwise its a great phone and id buy it again,LG,1,1,0

956,the original review still stand but two months in the screen start have extreme burn in if youre in a pinch this be definitely worth it but the screen issue have me skeptical of purchase the same phone again it may be an isolate issue but its a cheap phone do i doubt thats the reason i wouldnt count on it after 6 months although i be a very heavy user i be worry it wouldnt play game like clash royale pubg and others but they play very well consider its very smooth in term of all the apps any moviegaming enthusiast would like and the screen be similar to the quality of my old iphone 6edited its a solid phone for the price the only con be the camera which isnt terrible but its definitely not as good as high end phone and the speaker quality otherwise great buy i would recommend,LG,0,0,1

996,this phone have great specs but be very clunky and hard to use on the go the good you probably already see how amaze this phone be on youtube or other review so im go straight to the point the bad my number one complaint be the fingerprint reader its slow compare to my old phone pixel 2xl and it work like 50 of the time even after program fingerprint multiple time its vey frustrate require a special addaptor tip to charge the phone when use the dual screen case each tip be 799 ship from lg say special adaptor tip doesnt work 100 with android auto connection drop every two minutes or no response message pop up on the stereo all glass construction make it extremely slippery if not use a case or the dual screen case this be my first all glass phone maybe this be normal or expect always on display be limit on info display and customisation options it can display picture some notifications and clock selfie camera its not a true 32mp it downsize file to 8mp dual screen turn off if battery be below 15 even if its plug to the charger must wait for 16 battery charge its run android 9 who know when the android 10 update be come out in the mean time android 11 beta be already out for some phone use the dual screen eat up the battery display behind the dual screen have the resolution of a calculator and only have space for 3 notification icons all in all be a good phone with good specs but in practice its really cluncky and akward to use would not recomend save your money,LG,1,1,0
997,i really enjoy this phone to start off with im not an android officiando but i love the dual screen feature of this phone it be so mucb better than split screen to operate mutiple apps at once ive have moments where im think ok i need to get off this app to get on this one only to realize oh yeah i can use the other screen the first do have a buv which cause it to feeeze on occasion but it get promptly replace and havent have any issue since i appreciate lg and their willingness to not necessarily follow the trend of the bigger name phone developers,LG,1,1,0
998,i want to love this device it seem so unique stand out against a sea of slabstyle phone two screen win me over immediately however in person this phone do not impress me the second screen be interest but i find myself with the second screen just sit there wait to be use most of the time i like be able to fold away the dual screen when not in use however this just feel like admit defeat you spend money on the second screen so tuck it away seem like a waste so then you feel obligate to find use for it id love to be able to open link from the main screen facebook email on the dual screen however this be not possible i like how texting and facebook messenger would put your keyboard on one screen and the conversation on the other this be one of the main reason i buy the phone however type on it have less charm than i have anticipate it doesnt match up to tactile qwerty keyboards of yesteryear and the key even when ergonomically split out wide closer to your thumb still felt like a chore while game on this phone could be fun battery dwindle quickly when both screen be in use so id have a charger handy i like the dedicate google assistant button and both screen look great as many review have say before this be an interest idea that fall just short of be a great purchase just enough off the mark that ill be switch back to a bore old slab until something else interest come along,LG,0,0,1
999,a pseudofoldable that doesnt cost 2000 and be still water and dustresistant i call that a win its a different use model than the samsung galaxy fold though the samsung be intend to give you a single doublesize screen whereas the lg g8x give you dual monitor for run separate apps ie multitasking there be an app that allow you to run any other app across both screen but i find that i dont use that nearly as much as just run separate apps on the two screen my niggle 1 the front of the dual screen case be a mirror fingerprint magnet nightmare what be they think 2 the notification screen be only minimally useful a larger color screen would be more useful but they presumably do this to hold down cost and battery life impact 3 the little white button slideout thingy that you have to press in order to turn on the dual screen after insert the phone in the case be annoy af its too tiny to reliably press on and after youve enable the dual screen it just stick around to interfere with any apps you be run on the main screen would be infinitely more useful if it be also available as a home screen iconwidget my hope be that since the dual screen case be technically an accessory that lg or third party will come out with a gen 2 or other variants of the case that expand and refine its functionality that g8x owners can buy separately rather than have to wait and rebuy the next generation of phone,LG,1,1,0
1000,awesome phone for multitasking can do multiple function at the same time with two screen everything about this phone be well put together i just take my sim card from old phone and pop it in within 5 mins i be up and run,LG,1,1,0
1001,it be a good phone so far there be small differences from a samsung so im still adjust i greatly enjoy the second screen i can look up a recipe on one screen while watch a video of someone make the recipe on the other,LG,1,1,0
1002,the dual screen be great for multitasking it be however limit in what it can do for example you cant watch netflix full screen but you can watch it on one screen and do something on the other lg be quality as usual its a little on the heavy side but you can take the phone out separate from the dual screen case,LG,1,1,0
1003,this product be not universal compatible it be not available with all lte phonesphone service i have boost mobile which be on sprint network they could not send me a sim card for lq g8 thinq phone boost mobile don t support this phone please check with your mobile phone carrier prior to purchase this phone they will tell you the truth if this phone be compatible with your network,LG,0,0,1
1004,this phone have be heaven send let address the elephant in this phone not a foldable screen it have two screen so yes by know mean a samsung fold so here be where this get interest i have the samsung galaxy fold but i use my lg dual screen a lot more and prefer my lg a lot more for a few reason 1 the price 700 vs 2100 2 the build quality be much better than the fold 3 mult task be way easier with the split screen 4 it handle everything i throw at it and never boggle down i would go out on a limb and recommend this phone and yes i know its a lg phone but my honest opinion the best value and superior build quality and price point make this the besphonce choice available today so if you be in the market for an amaze phone and it have to burn a hold in your pocket i highly recommend that you give this phone a try take the leap like i do,LG,1,1,0
1005,the phone come with great feature the screen be very beautiful the cameras be at the level of the lead phone and i be hop for an optical zoom camera the dual screen be a great idea and practical and this make the phone at an excellent price the fingerprint on the screen work well the sound in the phone be excellent and pure and the sound come out from the bottom of the phone and also from the headphones answer call finally i hope lg phone return to the middle east,LG,1,1,0
1006,love it still learn about phone its easy to work still havent use bixbyi prefer google type when i talk to type message battery life be greatthe finger print sensor be on front of phone and it take a few try for me to have my finger recognize i have to keep add fingerprint to the memory also i do get the unlock version and all i have to do be take the phone to sprint to let them activate it for free they provide me with sim card that i do have to buy for a small fee also i would be careful when buy screen protectors some of them cover the sensor and be too thick so it wont recognize your fingerprint i have be get phone update and everything be work great the phone come with a charger and ear bud i would recommend,samsung,1,1,0
1007,i buy this phone to gift for someone and after i recieved it it doesnt come with a factory seal it just have a single tape hold the box together on the in side the box the phone have a minor scratch on the screen and the phone battery be not 100 seem like it be use and reset it seem like im a bite picky but i spend almost 1000 for this to be a gift for someone i should get some thing new not something use and return call the customer service and the only thing they could do be just to return it i will buy another one and finger cross that i get a brand new factory seal box,samsung,0,0,1
1008,this phone be amaze with awesome battery life good sound speakers especially when dolby atoms be turn on i get the best graphics which show up alot in pubg gameplay i reccomend this purchase no problems whatsoever although i will say the fingerprint scanner take a while to get use to,samsung,1,1,0

1010,samsungs customer support be the absolute worst should you need to send your device in for repair like i do good luck on wait i be initially tell it could take up to seven business days from the time the tablet be receive at samsungs repair facility on the sixth business day after my device be receive at their repair facility i receive an email notify me my device be receive and it could take up to seven business days to repair then i make multiple call to samsungs customer service due to the conflict information and receive more conflict information from the representatives with alot of apologies some reps tell me they would resolve the issue and get back with me and i never hear anything back others tell me i receive the wrong information from samsung and other representatives each call with customer support involve the representative try to call the repair facility tell me they could never get in contact with the repair facility although they would leave a voicemail as if this would provide some level of comfort needle to say i be still in limbo without my device and weeks have go by i would strongly urgerecommend purchase a device from apple or some other reputable company due to the ordeal i have have to go through with samsungs customer support a very dissatisfy customer,samsung,0,0,1

1013,i take this phone out of the box plug it in to charge and it get soooo hot soooo quickly i be very scar i think to myselfhmmm this be how fire can start and i decide that either it be this specific phone that have an issue or it be the model of the phone and all have issue so i order the s10 and guess what the phone work like a charm do not heat up at all not when i play and not when i charge it so either the s10 be a bummer or the phone that i get be a lemon not sure either wayit go back,samsung,1,1,0
1014,i order this for the snapdragon 855 processor and us warranty instead i realize that i have receive the slower international version with the exynos processor that be even slower than the s9 processor the model number of the phone i receive be completely different from the model number on this page the us warranty be also not honor i find this out after set up the phone and look under the about phone option i be return this phone for sure dont buy it here and risk get a inferior phone when you be pay 1000 dollars its really disappoint,samsung,0,0,1
1015,get a lump of clay in some plastic wrap instead of the phone wall charger and cable if i want clay id go to a local creek and not pay 900,samsung,0,0,1
1016,this phone have exynos not snapdragon it be an international version and do not work with my straighttalk sim card first it doesnt connect to my mobile data i have to add an access point name so that the data would work second the call will not work unless the wifi call be on plus even when turn on the call hang up randomly sometimes wont even ring and 70 of the time i try to call someone a box show up that say not register on network i also cant send picture at all and my texts randomly wont send,samsung,0,0,1
1017,device be not a factory unlock device as mention in the seller description and contain a tmobile documentationboot screen upon boot i be notify that the device have be reset it be list as new and unactivated and i would need to log in under the account previously use for the device customer service do respond within minutes to my email explain the situation which be a good sign but now i have to call during my work hours to get everything straighten out they recommend a hard reset and send a video explain how to do so but nothing have work so far many recent comment appear to have similar issue,samsung,0,0,1
1018,buyer beware first unless you live in a city that have great cell signal dont buy this my 100 phone have much better signal i will likely sell this one just because its no good if you need a cellphone second the phone work well for 3 months then part of the display stop work when my son call to make a warranty claim they tell him he would likely be bill for the repair and that when they samsung open the phone to repair it it would void the warranty so therefore samsung themselves wont honor the warranty when their equipment be faulty and wouldnt you know the support window close on 627 the very day i call amazon to inquire about warranty so now apparently there isnt amazon support for it either the worst 800 purchase ever update i call samsung finally get to someone who encourage me to send it in she do say that if there be a sign of water damage the warranty would be void we live in a very humid climate great they fix it under warranty as it have 3 things wrong,samsung,0,0,1
1019,this review be for s10 model my previous phone be a sam s5 so that be my comparison i be a practical person not much game or social media my phone be my workhorse here be my good and bad fingerprint work 50 and you need to press hard the pattern unlock be faster curve glass the curve glass edge of s10 be always cause me to false touch the screen look nice though telephoto i look back at my last 2 years of photos very few portrait shots so i will not take advantage of telephoto glass back plate seem useless to me you need to cover it for protection so what be the point just add more weight same for color cover by case screen beautiful and it go right to the edge of device no border a little longer than i be use to the side key be high up on the device so stretch your finger wifi call not support on this unlock model you need a carrier brand version in usa performance its fast the north america version contain the newest qualcomm 855 cpu camera not use enough yet to comment i think i be lean to swap this out for the s10e version,samsung,0,0,1
1020,it have be a month since i purchase this phone while purchase this s10 i be a bite skeptic because it be an unlock phone i doubt whether it will be genuine us version or not i recieved this phone in 2 days from amazon prime ship kudos to its fast ship after i recieved i check this phone and it have snapdragon and it be register in samsung as an unlock phone i have be use this phone for a month and base on my experience here be some pros and con of s10 pros huge 61 inch display and bezel less you will love its display its have a slim design 78mm and feel almost no weight 157gm when you hold it i love this slim design camera quality be quite good compare to its previous version 3 cameras at back and one at front camera have be really improve in s10 but still lack behind pixel i love this blue filter mode and it have automatic light adjustment accord to your environment if its day brightness automatically go high and viceversa it be snapgradon buit and have 8gb ram so it have a quite a good speed and huge128 gb storage i love this device function of split screen you can use two app at a same time in a single screen as show in image accurate and fast finger print scanner and face scanner con battery last just for a day or less i be a average user i use phone frequently but doesnt use heavily still it last for about a day or sometimes less i need to charge this phone once in a day yes this phone have finger print scanner but with this function i be not able to get a strong finger print compatible screen protector overall this be a great phone for its price but it would be an ice on a cake if it have a longlasting battery,samsung,1,1,0
1021,i order the prismatic black but i get a flat black so i feel scammed on that count ive have it a couple of weeks so far and be generally really happy with it a big improvement over the gs7 and ive enjoy that phone a lot its faster the battery life be amaze the screen be beautifully crisp the fingerprint unlock isnt perfect but its a vast improvement the old one wouldnt recognize me half the time things i dont like when the screen be off its hard to tell the top from the bottom i need to tap on the screen to wake up the fingerprint reader i dont like that notice dont just show up on top bar they also pop up in miniature over any other screen im on article im read game im play anything i can drag the notice to the top of the screen to dismiss it but its annoy the thing i hate frikken bixby i would have be interest in explore it until i realize that they set the phone up to force you into use it you know that awesome and so very cool voice control for decline a call while the phone be ring you just say reject and it hang up how sweet be that well its go whoever make that decision should be fire now the only way to use voice command like that be to go thru bixby so first you have wake up that jerk hey bixby and then you can tell it to decline the call which mean its faster to just reach over and push the button totally lose the cool factor too i would have buy a gs9 to have keep this function so i refuse to strong arm into use bixby esp since its no faster than google assistant and doesnt seem to do anything the assistant doesnt do already i hope they rethink this good and fix it in a future update then this thing will be stellar,samsung,1,1,0
1022,this be the second review ive make along with receive my phone a week after it be expect it come straight from the box with chink in the screen and the screen be so fragile that almost every day a new dent show up in the screen from just sit in my pocket with a case i dont move around too much i have an office job so theres no reason for the screen to dent so much,samsung,0,0,1
1023,the worst purchase on amazon ever first the phone box be a bite damage second fingerprint work slow third geolocation didnt work correctly the phone couldnt recognise my timezone next i try to test phone and i realise that phone couldnt work with other languages but damn it be a samsung s10 it should work perfect and the worst thing be i buy phone as a part of light deal which include phone galaxy bud and gift card 50 and when i try to return all items amazon say that i cant return gift card and they can refund me full price minus 50 i contact with customer service and first specialist say that it be not a problem they can just deactivate card and return me full price since it be a part of the deal however second specialist say that amazon cant do that and that first specialist be wrong honestly i didnt expect such a trick from amazon very disappoint i often order something from amazon but now i have to rethink that,samsung,0,0,1
1024,description above say that the phone be sell be smg973uzkaxaa however the phone that be send to me be smg973u1zkax while the number be similar they be definitely not the same phone the phone i be suppose to get be the us version which come with a 12month limit warranty the phone that i receive be the international version it be not cover by a warranty in the us amazon customer service be promptly send me a replacement i give 2 star because i have yet to be able to use the phone if the replacement prove to be the correct model and do everything its suppose to i will edit this review accordingly one thing that i can say for certain be that the fingerprint scanner be greatly improve when samsung say that it be 1touch scan it mean one touch flat and simple,samsung,0,0,1
1025,i be a little skeptical order an unlock phone i have the s7 and have never get an unlock phone before plus some of the review i saw make me skeptical however i be very please with my purchase the s10 work flawlessly i be not use the face recognition so i cant comment on it the fingerprint scanner work great for me yeah i sometimes have to try my fingerprint twice but it honestly doesnt bother me the camera be superb i go and get the otterbox defender case for it and i would always recommend get a case for your smartphone switch from my att s7 to this unlock s10 be as simple as insert my sim card into the new phone all in all im very please with this phone,samsung,1,1,0
1026,i get the galaxy s10 since my wife have the s9 plus and my son the s10e i like the display a lot include the color brightness and especially the coverage as almost the entire phone be just an active screen i choose the s10 over the s10 plus mostly because the s10 plus have a bigger cut out for the front face camera there be a second lens on the s10 plus but its my understand that this additional lens be just a depth sensor i dont take that many selfies so the approx 3x larger cut out be not worth it the screen on the plus be also just a bite larger same number of pixels as the s10 bixby be annoy on this phone when you swipe to the leave you get bixby on most android phone when you swipe to the leave you get a screen of apps on my old phone i use a leave swipe to get to entertainment apps and a right swap to get the productivity apps with samsung phone not just the s10 i have to put all apps to the right so to get to the entertainment apps i now have to swipe twice to the entertainment apps its not a terrible issue but still annoy the major issue i have with this phone be the indisplay fingerprint reader first of all the location be kind of awkward when you hold the phone the natural position of your thumb be around the center of the screen but the sensor be at the bottom of the phone this be not specific to samsung much worse if you dont put your thumb exactly where the sensor be it wont recognize it they be supposedly work on fingerprint sensors that work over the whole display which will improve this issue but for the s10plus you have to be very accurate where you place your thumb not only that even if you place your thumb at the right position it still take about 15 second for the phone to unlock all my previous phone include chinese brand like zte and honorhuawei have the sensor on the back you didnt have to think where to place your finger your finger be just at the right place when pick up the phone in addition the phone unlock a lot faster than the samsung my wifes s9 plus have a sensor in the back which be a lot better than the indisplay sensor of my s10 my sons s10e have the sensor build into a button on the right side of the phone its not quite as good as have a dedicate sensor in the back but still a lot better than my indisplay sensor the only drawback of the s10e be that the screen doesnt cover quite as much as on the s10 and the screen be still a bite smaller than the s10 i wish samsung would have use the same s10e fingerprint sensor on the s10,samsung,1,1,0
1027,get this phone brand new for prime day for a steal this phone be phenomenal and it keep the headphone jack honestly one of the best devices out there the only thing hold it back be the fingerprint reader it be a nice new technology but i think it hinder the phone in many ways first you cant get a regular screen protector which i think be absolutely necessary for this device the edge screen already make it fragile and not be able to use a temper glass screen protector add unnecessary risk i think the s10e have the right idea by add it to the side and i think these phone should have follow suit dont get me wrong its cool but its completely unnecessary thats the only negative actually this phone be beautiful in every way despite the fingerprint scanner it be my favorite phone ive recently try the iphone 11 and xs but this phone be the phone to beat those be nice but this phone be the most complete package you could ask for camera be unbelievable there versatility be amaze yes i know the iphone 11 pro also have these cameras but this phone be rock them a few months prior and be a fraction of the price on prime day,samsung,1,1,0
1028,this be not factory seal and be not unlock by samsung there be a piece of ship tape use to keep the box together,samsung,0,0,1
1029,just like many other order i receive the wrong model number i purchase the advertise model smg973uzkaxaa but be send smg973u1zkax just like the other reviewers state even though the model seem similar they be in fact different the advertise version be a us version which come with a 12 month warranty by samsung as well as contain the snapdragon chip the one that i be send doesnt come with warranty and have an inferior processor i be privy to the review as i trust the 45 star rat system without read the review first a big mistake amazon should check the bar code before send the wrong order to this many people i be currently await a replacement since i do want an s10 as my primary phone,samsung,0,0,1

1032,receive open box really dissapointed,samsung,0,0,1
1033,what can i say that hasnt already be say about the phone its a top tier phone with the best screen on the market the cameras take amaze picture and the three lenses with their apertures give you a lot of flexibility in photo take the battery easily last a day so most people should be fine unless theyre heavy power users but even for those folks the phone do charge up really quickly i also love the speakers on the phone the two channel sound with adobe atmos sound really create the illusion of surround sound within reason this be a phone after all i pick up the phone during prime day when they be sell them at a 300 discount so for that price the phone be a no brainer for me upgrade from a galaxy s7 this be a nice leap for me i dont know if i would recommend the phone at 900 but thats mostly on principle i dont believe any phone should cost as much as a midrange laptop so if you can pick this phone for a reasonable price i would highly recommend it,samsung,1,1,0
1034,so far i be love this ive use it for five days it be easier to switch to an unlock phone than i expect i love the face recognition method of unlock your phone you just look at the phone and swipe so much easier than constantly have to enter your pin every time the screen go dark i also love the crispness of the display since im get older my eye can use the assist my last phone be a galaxy 7 when i get this one on cyber monday my husband claim the g7 ive also use it to read book ive experiment with bixby only a little we will see how it go so far im in love,samsung,1,1,0
1035,this be absolutely the worst phone ive ever buy samsung refuse to hold up their warranty so amazon do i either receive a faulty refurbish phone or another defective samsung galaxy s10 because this one be worse now i have to request a replacement for this one to me samsung be a terrible company i do appreciate amazons help with this problem,samsung,0,0,1
1036,work pretty well its not suppose to be the international vs so im not sure why it be automatically in spanish and i have to switch a few things to have it revert to usa english a few of the app folders it create be also in spanish but be simple to rename the finger print scanner be a little finicky but i think it will just take some get use to and the face scanner be annoy since its 5050 if im wear glass or contact but i be pleasantly surprise that it still work the camera and resolution be absolutely fantastic and i love the one hand option in samsung products since i hate how big phone have get make it hard for me to use with my small girl hand,samsung,1,1,0
1037,edit end up return because we could not get a signal at our house never have a problem with the old phone call att and they could not figure out how to fix the problem also these unlock phone do not allow wifi call with att decide to return and purchase directly from att and end up get two phone for the price of this with their bogo gift card offer be hesitant to order this on prime day due to all the review that say it be not a snapdragon version but decide to take the chance i receive an unlock snapdragon samsung s10 confirm with geekbench and cpuz pop in an att sim card from old phone and good to go husband love his upgrade phone he love the face recognition and the battery life overall happy i decide to take the chance,samsung,1,1,0
1038,great screen good battery life everything just work love the 3 forward face cameras i havent try out the fingerprint reader or face recognition yet i can definitely tell the processor be beef up from my old phone certain game use to make my old phone hot it even have to shut down a couple time this phone handle the game easily the only nits i like have the physical button for home i understand why they do away with it real estate but i still miss it also the newest version of android doesnt appear to support frameless icons i miss the feature so i find an app which would restore it extremely minor nits id buy the phone again in a heartbeat initial setup i switch over from an older samsung phone plop the storage card and sim into the new phone hook up the cable to transfer data from my own phone come with the phone follow very nice transfer and setup wizards in about 30 minutes total i be up and run with all my old apps and data,samsung,1,1,0
1039,awful so counterintuitive no physical home button the virtual home button do not even appear most of the time when you need it voicetotext accuracy be even worse than on the s6 i trade in none of the apps or settings transfer properly it just go on and on with bad functionality all the way around no spellcheck stupid swipetoanswer setup why not just tap the button on and on with the worst backward functionality the s10 be a bad joke play on consumers include me,samsung,0,0,1
1040,the one star review have me a bite worry but im glad they didnt sway me away from purchase the phone heres a few things 1 it be unlock 2 if in the usa you might not be able to simply swap in a sim card from an old phone and have it work right away youll need to contact your carrier and theyll set it up for you metro pcs charge about 16 for this 3 the phone meet the descriptions 4 it work great and have no problems scammers will sometimes order things from amazon and then swap out the item with something else that weigh the same like replace items with clay or dirt or rock and send it back to amazon i think theres some case where these items appear to have never be open and get put back into stock only to find its way to someones home who then have most of these 1 star issue as for the product itself its very nice personally i use an s7 and dont plan on upgrade for at least two or three more years the s10 be great with its full face screen even though theres a dot where the camera be get a case get a good case people complain about the screen break but if you mishandle your phone it can break like any other phone nobody in their right mind would walk around with a 650 device that will break when drop at waist level if unprotected wrap it up the screen come with a protector already instal but do get a case for it that add protection you can use a usbc to hdmi cable to connect your phone to different devices samsung dex come with the phone so you can use it like a portable computer if you want or use screen mirror via cable you can also cast your screen to other devices if those devices allow for it rokuchromecastetc the camera be nice the selfie side do leave a bite to be desire though good thing im not narcissistic id rather take photos of my feet id buy this phone for myself if i have an older phone like a galaxy s4s5,samsung,1,1,0
1041,i have be use this phone for a month after upgrade from a asus zenfone 3 and i love it also have a headphone jack so thumb up to samsung i do just about everything on this phone and it handle it no problem the 8gb of ram be more than enough to run multiple apps all at once i usually have my music player google map with sit view youtube amazon prime video a game and multiple browser tabs on chrome and the performance doesnt dip at all the battery life last me all day long and sometimes two days with moderate usage no game or videos on an 80 charge the fast charge save me a lot of time be able to go from 10 to 80 in about an hour or so but you may have different result because all batteries be different the screen be beautiful color be amaze sharpness be crisp and the responsiveness be snappy there isnt much else to say there camera be just as great but that be to be expect from a 900 flagship speaker be surprisingly loud and clear without any hint of distortion and come out of the top and bottom speakers however the default sound quality for music be flat and i would advise that you turn on dolby atmos immediately and tweak the equalizer a few complaints that i have echo other people in that the fingerprint sensor leave a lot of be desire sometimes it read my finger instantly sometimes i have to play with it a bite sometimes it fail to read it altogether and i have to enter in the code placement of the sensor be locate at the bottom of the screen which be not ideal in my opinion id much rather have it on the back the bixby button be also occasionally a pain in the ass i keep my phone in my pocket a lot and if i accidentally press the button while try to adjust the volume i have to pull it out of my pocket to exit out of bixby because it would stop my music from play a great feature that they add make it so that you can remap the bixby button to open with a long press or double press but i just remapped it to open my music player instead so that my music will keep play,samsung,1,1,0
1042,very well design product camera work great and all software very responsive samsung pay with mst be another great feature allow use phone pay with traditional credit card readers without nfc by simulate a magnetic card swipe do not work with recess card readers like the ones at the gas station though battery life be not great but adequate will last through the day with normal use of gps browser and talk only slight issue be the fingerprint reader be not as sensitive as a dedicate fingerprint reader and require a harder press on the screen buy a second unit for myself after buy the first one for my wife,samsung,1,1,0
1043,overall i really like the phone so far this be a switch from the s6 it really be not much bigger than the s6 though i would like it a little smaller look forward to discover the new feature the ship of the item on the other hand i live overseas and order this phone because it be unlock and i want to use it here and in the state typically i experience items that be overprotect with form or ship air bubble but this be in a box with other items and have zero protective pack the primary box arrive to the post office damage the other items in the box be fine and not in need of special pack the phone be in the box and in a seal plastic bag i open the bag and it appear the phone have be move slightly i do not want to hassle with a replacement because the device appear to have no issue and i be not sure if i would have any better luck with a replacement the replacement process be also a hassle in that i be require to pay for the ship we will see if i encounter any issue in the come weeks,samsung,1,1,0
1044,a wonderful product continue the samsung galaxy s lineup in its natural progression it still have the quirk of samsung fiddle with the phone os to make it their own but it be a solid topoftheline model phone that have a long last battery relative to the performance it provide and if you can find it at price that you find reasonable be a smart purchase im certainly bias towards pureandroid phone and this iteration isnt that bad of a compromise in term of how much samsung have plaster on to it consider how easy it be to disable the bloatware and install a different home manager,samsung,1,1,0
1045,samsung state that if the phone be purchase by a certain date the phone come with a set of wireless earbuds while i like the phone i be upset that the advertise free item be ignore the moral of the story amazon may not fulfill what be advertize or if you pay for something with point they take their time and accept the order until later have i know this i would not have rush to buy it have i not have have this problem i would have give it another star by the way it do not come with an s stylus like previous phone and tablets,samsung,0,0,1
1046,att want 899 for this phone with the 200 off sale price plus amazon prime day special i get it for 599 nothing negative towards seller at all i love this phone but i wont marry it oo att on the other let you byod but nowhere in their policy do it say that your unlock phone wont have all the feature of the att brand s10 i lose video call never use it wifi call also never use it and call protection which i do use after 4 unsuccessful result wit my call to att customer service i visit an att store where a rep there tell me the above information why didnt their customer service know this,samsung,1,1,0
1047,i be skeptical about upgrade my s9 to an s10 but franklyit be worth it a small crack in the screen of my s9 end up push me over the edge and in hindsight im glad youre pay for some gimmicky feature to be sure powersharing and the wideangle lens to name a couple but the overall buildquality improve camera software and streamline android pie skin alone make the s10 worth the price to be clear i love this phone but here be some of the downsides for those of you who like me look for the worstcase scenario in order to determine whether or not they could live with those flaw 1 the fingerprint reader im not really sure what be so dysfunctional or invasive about the rearfacing capacitive fingerprint scanner but the inscreen sensor just doesnt work 100 of the time ive get better at find the correct spot with my finger over the last month but i would say that i still miss about 15 timeswhich can be annoy thankfully the face unlock be pretty smooth for those of you who be comfortable with a less secure form of screenunlocking that say if you want to use the fingerprint unlock even a little bite you really cant have a reasonably price temper glass screen protector on your phone which suck 2 the punch out isnot ideal have use an iphone x for a while i can say definitively that its better than the notch but with the improve durability of the mechanically retract frontfacing camera units and the admittedly problematic emergence of underscreen cameras it just seem like the holepunch be a bite of a gapfiller for people who be desperate for more screen realestate i cant say that i forget about the holepunch completely but it also isnt obtrusive or offensive to me at this point its just part of the experience 3 bixby even though you can now remap the bixby button no matter what you do there will always be a certain kind of press doublepress singlepress or press and hold that bring up some form of bixby its kind of like when youre walk past sidewalk canvassers that be raise money for a cause that you definitely believe in you can appreciate that the intent be pure and you may even like what they have to offer but you want to give them your time on your own term and when the pushier they get the less interest you becomei may be get lose in my metaphor but you get what im try to say and thats it those be literally the only problems ive have the cameras be great the live focus mode be better than in some case even iphone x portrait mode the response time and process power be topnotch and the screen be just unbelievable hope this help you in your quest to find a new mechanical device to which you will inevitably devote half of your day reveal all of your personal information and possibly sell your soul,samsung,1,1,0
1048,preface i only ever own iphones up until i buy this phone so my review will be base on how well the phone be and how user friendly the operate system be compare to ios pros lightweight slim good camera phenomenal battery life screen protector instal con slow fingerprint reader cant access certain settings in lockscreen find a decent case the phone be slim and lightweight that i barely feel it in my hand for some it might be a con but for me thats a pro further a decent case can give it a nice weight the camera be nicer than i expect but to be fair im not one to obsess about phone cameras the battery life last quite a while especially if you go to the settings and change the battery power settings to optimize or medium power save mode typically for me it last up to 8 hours while i either play music text and browse the internet at work with music only it last far longer last a screen protector come preinstalled its a nice touch and it mean i didnt have to buy one however the screen protector be on the flimsyer side it get easily scratch after a week with nothing in my pocket but my phone the screen protector get small scratch cannot really complain since it be free but still just let people know move on to the con the fingerprint reader be slower than expect i have try put my fingerprint multiple time but it do not compare well to iphones mind you the difference be about a second or so but my old iphone se could read my fingerprint faster some case for this phone be flimsy and wont provide the protection need so its best to find a youtube video i find a video about 30 minutes long with the person do a quick review of like 30 case around a minute or so per case he show the case place it on the phone drop the phone with he case on it to see if it would protect the phone and check to see if wireless charge would work further the review on some of the case be so bizarre as some dont even seem to belong to the item the person be talk about also there be multiple time that i search for samsung galaxy s10 phone case click on a case i find intrigue just for it to be only for an s10 or s10e and i know to check under the product for the tab that allow you to change the style and sometimes even for what phone you want many of the ones i pick do not have this option now onto the operate system some settings i be use to have on ios be not find on android for instance the music player on the lock screen be not well place or have a way to skip certain part of a song also if i want to quick respond to a text i have to unlock the phone and respond from the app if i want to turn on or turn off the wifi or data again i have to unlock the phone even if i use the pull down menu in the lock screen on the other hand android have make change that have make the operate system user friendly for someone change from ios for instance you can choose to hide apps the way android traditionally handle apps or you can have them across multiple page on the homescreen reminiscent of ios overall though by download some apps and change certain settings i be able to easily adapt to the phone by the end of the first week i could not go back to my old phone,samsung,1,1,0
1049,when i receive the phone in box i open the box usually when you buy new phone everything come in proper package usb c to usb connector be roam inside box it be not on its place charger be not properly place charge cable be usually tide with wire tie and in this one it be just come without it seem some one try to use this phone or some on temper this phone or it could be refurbish phone never know,samsung,0,0,1

1265,same specs as huawei 350 buck phone,samsung,1,1,0
1266,i can t believe how horrible the fingerprint scanner be on this thing during setup i have to push way too hard on the screen for it to register my fingerprint and once set up it fail to recognize my fingerprint more than 50 of the time i try different finger and try reregistering them twice even try a factory reset huge disappointment have to return it get the note 9 instead since it s 350 off,samsung,0,0,1
1267,this be not the american version of the phone this be the europe version which have different processors and be cheaper the europe version also doesnt come with an american warranty check the model number and google it make sure you receive the correct model the american version and international version of the phone be both great phone i dont like be charge for a more expensive phone and get a cheaper one i think its extremely mislead,samsung,0,0,1
1268,i travel all over the us and europe and this phone work great sleek form fit and function a i purchase an armband for runningworking out and the phone have have zero issue important note to all purchase the phone come with a preinstalled screen protector which be solid my wife have long acrylic fingernails and be unable to peel it from the screen overall im satisfy with the phone upgrade upgrade from an s7 edge my only issue be all my previous charge cable for the s7 be null as the s10 have a different charge port require me to purchase new charge cable,samsung,1,1,0
1269,loveeee the phone its amaze without a doubt i really think the s10 would be fine for my hand sizeguess time to go for the,samsung,1,1,0
1270,i upgrade from s9 to s10 in general it be great smart phone one of the great feature that the processor be super fast with download or surf the web and very stable however i have the follow downsides on the s10 1 the finger print recognision be not as easy or smooth to unlock the devise s9 finger print be faster and more accurate 2 battery life in s9 do last longer than the s10,samsung,1,1,0
1271,my last phone be a samsung on5 so it be take me time to adjust and evaluate it some of the things be equally aggravate like touch control not work when you want it to and sensitive when not want it to and yes i know there be a touch control i hate when products change things like icons widgets avatars or whatever new name they can assign them not only the picture but color and even action they designate if they find the need for a change at least give me the option of keep the old look so i dont have to spend needle time find things this apply to most computerize tech hardware and software i be most reluctant to get new stuff because of this i didnt buy a new phone for these silly change i buy a new phone for better storage larger screen better camera voice recorder etc instead it appear i have to go to an app store to get one that come with a much cheaper phone so larger memory be not as large as claim i spend half the time try to figure out how to navigate the new product this do not make me want to buy the next model sorry i have better things to do with my lifetime for these reason i be give it only 3 star,samsung,1,1,0
1272,finally get an update to my wifes phone she have be through 2 replacement batteries in the note 4 and the screen be burn it still work but be get pretty sluggish she will only use samsung and have plan on get another note but the prime day deal on the s10 be too good to pass up she absolutely love the phone she take a lot of picture and the camera upgrade have be the best part of the upgrade with a 256gb card she have plenty of space for all the photos she can take the s10 have a data app migration app that make it simple to move just what she want from the note to the s10 she be even able to keep texts which i assume she would lose a trip to a local att store for a new sim card and everything work right off very please with this phone,samsung,1,1,0
1273,some will read this review and say okay boomer and thats fine since it fit me perfectly i upgrade from an s6 to an s10 just because the s6 be fine the s10 be better most everything migrate fine from one phone to the other use samsungs app a few things in contact didnt transfer nor do a few things in calendar interestingly birthdays make it to the new calendar but appointments vacation concert etc didnt for those of us at a certain age familiarity be nice the s10 will allow you to make your home page and other app page look like your old s series phone which be a great comfort to me the phone be advertise as have a much better battery maybe not so much it hold a charge for about a day just like my old phone it have a bunch of helpful settings the s6 didnt and they be easy to understand and setup even for the technologychallenged like me there be one amaze glitch which have since be resolve crazy as it sound i could not answer an incoming call press the green phone button didnt work use the volume button didnt work per samsungs suggestion finally while on an online chat with samsung a system upgrade download guess what i can now answer my phone not with a press but a swipe although a swipe didnt work b4 upgrade anyway i like the new phone it wasnt a necessity and i cant call anyone i couldnt call with the old phone but i enjoy it i think you will too,samsung,1,1,0

1284,have be look at this phone for a while but refuse to pay the go price then get a deal from amazon when they have their prime days its a really nice phone replace my lg v20 which be still a good phone but the samsung be noticeably faster i still prefer the size of my lg wish now i have get the s10 but i can live with this one i always buy factory unlock so i can use whatever sim i want and no contract currently use a tracfone sim in this one,samsung,1,1,0
1285,i absolutely love the galaxy s10 only thing i wish be that it have a 5000 mah battery because battery life be okay its not bad but definitely could be improve power users will want to carry a external battery with them in order to use this phone at maximum potential ie have the screen bright keep it run at high performance without use power save function plus it come with a screen protector its not the best one but i love that it come with one,samsung,1,1,0
1286,i just get my phone yesterday so im just get use to it so far it be great i love the camera how fast it be but the home button and back button arent really button they be right under the keyboard so i end up hit them all the time only drawback so far,samsung,1,1,0
1287,this be an excellent phone with a great screen and a headphone jack the two things i care the most about come from an s8 usage of this phone be familiar though ill admit that i prefer the finger print reader i have before this one take more try to unlock overall its a pretty big step up and a phone that i plan to hold onto for years largely thank to the disappearance of headphone jack on flagship phone couldnt be happier with my choice of a phone,samsung,1,1,0
1288,i hate the curve screen there be color shift around the edge and the screen be always register touch from just hold the phone otherwise the phone be fine but too thin to hold without a case i like the speed of the s10 over the s7 but the form factor of the s7 better i like the removable battery in the s5,samsung,0,0,1
1289,confirm directly with samsung that i receive a us version phone pop our tmobile sim chip in and work right away great screen great camera,samsung,1,1,0
1290,best phone by far fingerprint reader be troublesome but just set the screen sensitivity higher then it work perfectly camera be excellent wow battery life compare to my old s7 be phenomenal no issue just a fast good look phone with alot of feature,samsung,1,1,0
1291,awesome phone just be sure that you know what you be buy this be the international version of the phone which be a tiny bite slower than the us version which have a better processor in it both phone be incredibly good though,samsung,1,1,0
1292,just an fyi to anybody look to use this phone with virgin moble this model be block have to move to sprint just to use this phone but whatever other than that love this phone i have the s8 for almost 4 years and decide to upgrade and this one be perfect,samsung,1,1,0

1326,great phone,samsung,1,1,0
1327,its a good phone not great but good go from the s7 to the s10 be quite change since the front physical button go away i love the full screen but definitely miss my button the fingerprint detector normally take me a few time before it unlock which be the only main frustration in my book the second minor grump be sometimes when it be unlock the screen look as if its still lock so i continue to touch it before i notice that it be actually open and you just need to swipe to make it look open maybe they could change the blur to the app icons immediately when the fingerprint work the speaker be a huge improvement music and phone call sound even more clear than with the s7 it also seem to have a much louder volume ability with apps such as spotify which be an issue with the s7 the cameras be a big improvement as well lot of photo options and even better pics in dim areas the processor speed be also noticeable it open apps and slide flawlessly very smooth operation and video be almost instant i be please with the purchase and be hop they can fix the few bug mention before with software patch,samsung,1,1,0
1328,screen be gorgeous phone be fast and responsive cameras be great here be the problem the signal strength be piss poor i never have full bar and the phone constantly drop call and go to roam or no service this apparently be a know issue google s10 signal strength seriously i can lay my phone without a case right next to an s7 edge both on sprint and there be a 10 signal loss on the s10 samsung give me the run around i wish i have never buy this phone i ll tell you this much after use samsung phone for over 10 years i will never buy another one,samsung,1,1,0
1329,i havent own a samsung galaxy since the s3my last seven phone have be from huawei or xiaomi and before that from one plus essential and google nexus and pixel but after several years of use international unlock phone i want to try an android phone specifically mean for use in the unite state again and since one plus and pixel phone be ludicrously overprice samsung end up be pretty much the only choice the good the galaxy s10 feature the latest generation snapdragon 855 processor in north america china and japaneverybody else get samsungs inferior inhouse exynos processor instead and plenty of ram so its fast and powerful the display be nice both large and bright with excellent color on paper the display support hdr allow 4k content from netflix to be view with the best color accuracy but when watch movies and television episodes on a 64inch smartphone screen im not sure how anyone can actually tell the ultrasonic fingerprint scanner and face unlock be fast although i didnt test how secure either actually be the battery be large and should provide even heavy users who do lot of media stream or game with a full day of power on a single charge signal strength and call quality be excellent you even get a headphone jack and a slot for an external memory card two feature you almost never see these days on flagship smartphones the samsung galaxy s10 also run android pie which be currently the latest version of android the bad while samsung use to have one of the best android cameras they have fall behind chinese rival huawei and xiaomi the camera on the s10 be solid and take good enough picture but as flagships go it doesnt measure up to the competitionparticularly where low light shots be concern samsung have be use the same camera sensor on its galaxy line since the s7thats four generations of galaxy phone without an upgrade samsungs current charge technology be almost painfully slow compare with xiaomi and huaweiparticularly wireless charge which seem to take forever bixby which be suppose to be samsungs alternative to google assistant i dont know even one person with a samsung phone who actually use bixby but theres a dedicate bixby button on the s10 samsung need to either ditch the bixby button entirely or make it easier to remap the xiaomi assistant button can be remapped to google or alexa in second with samsung you need to download a thirdparty app from the play store have access to a computer download adb tool from google or another website enable the hide developer options menu on your phone and allow usb debug connect your phone to the computer open a command prompt window and then type the necessary adb commandsotherwise the bixby button be always map to bixby the galaxy s10 be less comfortable to hold than any phablet ive own in recent memoryoverall the size be virtually identical to the xiaomi mi 9 but the s10 feel awkward and the less than ergonomic button placement power button very high on the right side with bixby and volume button very high on the leave doesnt help the galaxy s10 might be a little on the heavy side thank to its large battery but a slightly more curve body and better button placement would have go a long way towards make the s10 more comfortable in the hand the speakers be loud the s10 come with a single bottomfiring speaker and a frontfacing earpiece speaker thats also use to create a stereo effectbut they dont really sound very good even with dolby atmos to enhance the quality samsung be terrible with software update for its official us unlock phonesright now its august and their unlock s10 be still on the may security patch in the us unlock smartphones account for an extremely small percentage of the market so samsung focus their resources on software update for carrierbranded model update for samsungs unlock us phone come months after the carriers get them the rest the use of a punch hole in the display for the frontfacing cameras and earpiece speaker be something i have mix feel about it do give samsung brag right on paper about a higher screen to body ratio but in practical everyday use the camera cutout be locate far enough from the top of the display that you end up with an unusually thick screenwasting taskbar when use apps not design for fullscreen modeand with fullscreen apps that have a light background the dark oval punchout be at least as distract as a notch samsung use its own custom skin on top of android call one ui the overall software experience isnt bad and there be definitely some useful feature that you wont find in stock android the problem be that samsung throw in an overabundance of feature that cant be disable even if you have no use for them so one ui end up needlessly drain the battery with more streamline software s10 owners could easily get two full days of normal use without a charge but one ui suck up way too much power for that to happen ultimately the biggest problem with the galaxy s10 be pricethe xiaomi mi 9 have the same snapdragon 855 processor as the s10 be every bite as fast charge more quickly take better picture and offer both faceunlock and an inscreen fingerprint reader and overall build quality superior to phone from google pixel and oneplus the xiaomi mi 9 list for 500 at launch but can currently be purchase for as little as 350 brand new with the galaxy s10 you get a nicer display and bigger battery but be that worth an extra 400600 there be two very large problems for smartphone consumers here in the unite state 1 apple and samsung have a virtual duopoly in the market here and account for roughly 70 of all phone sales in the unite state give apple and samsung pretty much no incentive to innovate or lower price 2 90 of consumers in the unite state purchase phone through their carriers give our phone carriers the power to act as the gateway to us customers and eliminate anything resemble freemarket competition in term of innovation and price the best android phone in recent years have come from xiaomi honor and huawei but none of those phone be on shelve here in the unite state thats allow samsung google pixel and oneplus to sell us consumers inferior phone at grossly inflate price the samsung galaxy s10 might currently be the best phone on the us marketit have significantly more premium build quality than phone from google pixel or oneplus it s fast and powerful have a big battery a great display and lot of feature but in a market with better choices pay more than 700 for the galaxy s10 would be hard to justify,samsung,1,1,0
1330,the phone be a miracle upgrade from an s6 zero regret most impress with the dynamic range of the image and the phenomenal battery life detail that may be interest some initial disappointment with the finger print reader wrt consistency finally i try a third digit middle finger seriously in do the initial imprint i place the distal flexion crease of the finger on the rim on the protective case and do all registration placements from that reference point when i open with the fp reader i place the crease on that rim of the case and just rock it forward onto the sweet spot for the id work 95 on the first try the armadillo tek hefty case which have prevent damage from several spill to the floor happily do not prevent charge with the ep 3100 wireless samsung charger work fine but charge the earbuds from the s10 thru this case do not work one final nitpick i be disappoint the s10 do not seem to offer the voice activate shutter release i use that on the s6 and like it,samsung,0,0,1
1331,i mostly love the phone but the bixby button be a pain bixby be the samsung ai helper the button be in a place that be almost halfway on the phone it get bump often and can not be turn off recently a tiny 21mb update would pop up at turn on and anytime the button be hit i didnt have wifi access and it refuse to update over the network until 2 weeks go by i have to click yes or no to the update it would tell me i need to be over wifi and i accept it let me leave screen so the normal pain of 1 screen to back out of be 3 on the issue of the star for face recognition if it be in my pocket or be hold and lock it would often look for a face it would often be hot use the battery only work with light and constantly have a bright red light it probably work great for some and bad for others,samsung,0,0,1

1350,ive use just about every smartphone os and be a longtime blackberry user until move to apple around 2012 i be able to play with every smartphone os for work and since android be hit or miss back then i settle for ios i decide to give android another try with the galaxy s9 yes i be also very skeptical about try a refurbish phone but give amazons gracious return policy i felt it be worth the risk my receive unit come in a plain white smartphone box and come with original samsung accessories new charger usb to usbc cable wire headphones and a usb to usbc adapter the phone itself be cover in plastic upon remove the plastic the phone look to be brand new zero scratch or ding on the screen perhaps a few superfine scratch on the back but hardly noticeable the phone come about 80 charge and power up with no issue disappointingly the phone come with the stock android 80 firmware while connect to wifi i didnt receive any update notifications which be annoy i put in my nanosim and again still no notifications to update a manual update didnt work either i start look to flash the appropriate android 9 image to the phone directly but after about 20 minutes i finally receive a notice to update sadly this be a linear process in total i probably do about 8 update a few 80 patch and then the large 90 update and then a few more 90 patch it seem with android os you cannot just upgrade to the latest android version lame that be say the phone have be work great with no issue there be some quirk about android 9 i dont like but then again there be a lot of feature to like positives s9 be still very fast device for 2019 gorgeous highresolution screen 570ppi faster charge compare to my iphone xs max very lightweight and a slim profile microsd slot accessories cost less spigen case for 13 can have 35 icons on a single page no need to swipe thru multiple page android apps seem more refine than apple apps and usually have more featuresoptions android os can be customize to users like negative a lot of useless samsung bloatware i dont need this crap fortunately it can mostly be hide or disable the speakers be not very loud even at full volume its hard to hear when drive around curve screen just dont like it i notice newer samsung phone be go back to flat screen yay sound setup in android os be a bite wonky include sound be pretty generic and lame need customization camera be good but android software be too busy need to consolidate settings for more simpler interface pro mode be very nice feature want ability to remove icon text label in android without have to use 3rd party utility,samsung,1,1,0

1445,i have be use s10 since last week and i have recently upgrade from s9 pros look and feel be great run fine camera be awesome awesome dispaly con samsung really need to step up when it come to basic very poor network reception many place my s9 have 50 more network connection when you be take a call from wifi and move out of network the call disconnectswhatsapp this be not happen in s9 although there be 23 sec interruption wifi to lte movement be not seamless fingerprint sensor be crap beyond imagination really really shit samsung support be not upto the mark crappy return policy i will update more as i spend more time with this phone i be very very dissatisfy,samsung,1,1,0
1446,i do not buy this from amazon in all fairness but i use amazon for a lot of my purchase so i figure id post my review here as a longtime android user 10 years mostly with nexus devices i can honestly say this phone be the worst user experience ive have in the android ecosystem issue with the fingerprint reader and samsung constantly prompt me to use their apps for standard google service sour me quickly the only positive i can say for this phone be the camera and video capabilities this phone kill android for me after 6 months of ownership and i replace it with an apple 11 pro max i never think i would leave the android ecosystem but the poor user experience seal the deal,samsung,0,0,1
1447,smartphone intro ive be buy the latest and greats smartphones since the early htc days and have own just about every significant samsung smartphone release since then every year i will stray over to other manufacturers to see what the big and small players be up to most but not all of the time i find myself right back to my samsung phone as the daily driver which be usually a note now that samsung have release another note series for an increasingly high price let see how it do in particular against my note 9 that its replace pros excellent build quality the highresolution oled display somehow look even better than before superfast performance zero lag much improve speakers that you can feel the bezels continue to disappear nearly allscreen core function such as phone call still work great lot of internal storage expandable storage generous battery that truely last allday fast wire and wireless charge for those very heavy phone usage days the everuseful stylus continue to evolve 3 camera lenses for any scenario great picture video quality with some useful feature con hole punch camera be distract the inscreen fingerprint reader take a few step back from the physical sensor rip headphone jack price keep go up design compare to the galaxy note 9 the galaxy note 10 feel much more substantial than i expect it have more heft and somehow even more solid feel to it in particular with the samsung oem case which be also expensive but continue the highquality impression of what you be hold in the hand the leave side have the volume updown and power button the bottom be usbc port and stylus holder the rest of the phone be fairly clean and simple i prefer power on the right but its easy enough to get use to after a few hours i opt for the white version to mix things up and i like it it still provide a nice highend look all while resist visible fingerprint and probably scratch than most darker and shinier color even with a 68 display its still roughly the same size as the note 9 there be now simply less bezel but due to the square corner it never feel small if you arent already use to large phone this will take some get use to and as manufacturers continue to slowly push the size of phone combine with no more bezels to shrink this be probably about as large as i expect a mainstream phone to go any further and folks be go to have issue software long ago this use to be samsungs weakest point theyd throw lot of halfbaked feature with no optimization result in lot of lag and bloat those days be long go samsung nail that down with the galaxy s9note 9 series except with the note 10 its even faster and smoother which i suspect much credit go toward the snapdragon 855 i should note that i be a fan of google android experience but every time i jump over to a google phone or another brand i immediately start to miss all of the small but very useful feature samsung have build into their phone the game launcher scene optimizer multiple lenses display quality highend specs etc and honestly after easily disable bixby there isnt that much bloat disableremove a few random apps like facebook and im good to go performance as note above the performance be absolutely fantastic usually while go through initial setup or instal apps these phone tend to get very laggy this be probably the only time i saw a hint of lag but surprisingly minimal in that i could easily and quickly perform other task while download and instal apps game music etc each year as performance increase the need for synthetic benchmarks decrease i think they still serve a purpose in limit usecases for a reliable baseline but today im not go to bother this phone be fast and can do everything you want display audio the 68 wqhd dynamic amoled display combine with some significantly improve speakers be simply the best upgrade from previous phone watch highresolution content on youtube or netflix look and sound fantastic i find myself glue to the screen during my demo session with various clip even the icons on the desktop almost pop from the screen as though they be right there touch your finger the speakers finally have some force behind them as well allow you to feel the vibrations in your hand and yes they be quite loud with atmosenabled they provide a great stereo separation effect ill also mention there be an include screen protect its very thin but its quite unobtrusive i usually remove these but since it virtually cover the entire screen and provide a smooth swipe experience ill leave it for now and last ill briefly mention the hole punch as it do have a negative impact with the multimedia experience anytime there be a bright scene around that area my eye be immediately draw to it this need go away sooner rather than later cameras as the camera count increase so too do the usefulness functionality and flexibility the rear now have a 16mb ultrawide camera 12mp wideangle camera normal and 12mp telephoto camera the introduction of wideangle be super useful and one i use very often each camera capture excellent picture i tell my pixel 3 and dont have it for comparison today be there better cameras available im sure there be but unless you be really compare backtoback i doubt youd notice in particular if you like to record video thats one area the pixel and some other phone dont do as well the stability and clarity when record 4k 60fp be excellent combine with solid audio record and youve get a great overall camera package im not into selfies but that 10mp camera be somewhat mandatory these days its unfortunate it have result in a small but very noticeable hole in the screen which as note above be absolutely noticeable in either case it take solid picture as well no complaints there fingerprint reader unfortunately there be another negative feature change with the galaxy note 9 and virtually every other phone with a physical reader you can just rest your finger and quickly unlockwake your phone with samsungs implementation of the inscreen reader you have to press firmly and wait a second for it to register and if it doesnt read your fingerprint right away it may be a few second or repeat attempt if the screen be turn on it do tend to be quicker but you still need to press firmly and wait longer than in the past im really hop a software update improve this otherwise i may just go back to the power button and a pin dex your phone there be a lot of other software feature but i do want to highlight these two as they be unique and stand out for me i get use to dex with my last samsung phone and there continue to be minor but useful improvements dex be surprisingly useful if you want to do some light work when im onthego i can easily plug in a usbc to hdmi cable bluetooth keyboardmouse and have a portable desktop experience you can also now use a normal usb cable and windows app to access dex its just not ideal for game and multimedia ive get personal and work email browser youtube office apps and a range of other tool i dont need to do video or photo edit on the go and i find this can meet just about any task i need or want to do while travel this be a little more useful on a tablet but in a different way as the keyboard be already include less to travel with and then there be the new your phone feature this be a little more early stage in development but still handy just plug in a usb cable to any windows pc and you can mirror whats on your phone you also have direct access to message but the mirror function be nice you can interact with your phone on the pc all while charge it id like to see more dedicate port into this app but be able to see and respond to any notification be great just dont expect to play game or smoothly stream youtube the phone thats right this be still a phone and as such it need to make phone call and other core function as i use this for both personal and work this be a critical but often overlook feature while it may feel like more of a checkbox item ive have more than a few phone over the years that still fail in this arena im please to report that phone call and text be excellent speakerphone work well no issue with hear anybody and vice versa the radio appear to be good quality bluetooth be reliable as well as wifi which be very fast im easily push 300400mbps updown with my google mesh wireless network conclusion so how exactly do you justify a 1100 phone honestly you really dont justify it at least not in the traditional sense my note 9 would have continue to serve me well for another year but we buy these phone because theyre interest they entertain us and they make life a little bite easier and consider the significant percentage of time many of us spend on these portable gadgets it start to make sense that we want to allocate more budget towards them while its not perfect no phone be i still believe samsung have enough feature functionality quality and performance for me to justify the galaxy note 10s price and keep it as my daily driver for another year ill still grab a few more phone that intrigue me between now and the note 11 but id be surprise if they truly replace this one if they can id welcome it,samsung,1,1,0
1448,my new note 10 arrive tuesday morning have own the note 1 note 2 note 4 note 7 for a few hours before it be recall and the note 8 i have more than a few expectations after 6 days of ownership i can honestly say every expectation be meet or exceed battery life unbelievable screen excellent include software great have use it on both verizon att with no problems not expect any problems in europe in a few weeks in multiple countries with 2 more service providers sims with 512gb build in and my instal 512gb micro sd card i can carry with me every document every picture every video that i want to not only for areas without or high price wifi but also as a secure backup for my small business file so why be i sorry i be sorry for the external battery sellers i dont need to carry one with me sorry that i have purchase multiple qc3 vehicle chargers dont need most of them almost sorry i have 3 tablets 2 at offices 1 at home have not quite give those up but they may end up for sale be the phone overprice of course it be however it be something i use virtually every wake hour extremely please with it,samsung,1,1,0
1449,upon receive the goods there be box scratch screen scratch i dont want to exchange because i hate wait next time ill go buy a mobile phone store,samsung,0,0,1
1450,ill keep this short phone be great and all but move from the rog phone to this one be super hard and this be mainly because the refresh rate 120 back to 60 be actually kind of strain on the eye now eye be kind of sensitive besides this everything else be great oh and if you dont like the hole punch in the middle because of video watch there be like this semi full screen mode that just black bar the side and its great but 60hz on a 1200 phone hurt the soul,samsung,1,1,0
1451,slightly concern as the box have be open before get to me the phone seem to be new from everything i can tell but that take some of my excitement awaynot know for sure if someone have handle the phone prior to me the sticker that be usually on the back of the phone be not presentyou could see where it have be the phone be quite nice although not sure its worth 1200 buck the camera be not really what the youtube reviewers say it isit do a lot of soften to faceseven with beauty mode turn off not sure if im keep the phone after all of the abovestill decide,samsung,0,0,1
1452,the phone be defective out of the box i have spend hours on setup before i realize i contact samsung support get a tech that know less about the phone than i do grrrhate that waste my time and still didnt work my s pen would not operate the camera one of the feature i upgrade for from the note 8 basic feature be fine its a good phone but i buy it for a camera upgrade just a waste of time i just plan to returnwhat if the next one have another problem oh the picture be not much improve,samsung,0,0,1
1453,the note 10 be like that one popular kid everyone know at school it have many cool feature no headphone jack but it just have the best look buy the note 10 iphones be overprice,samsung,0,0,1
1454,i purchase this phone because my old galaxy s7 finally bite the dust i have in fact purchase phone for my parent the note 8 and note 9 and i have see how impressive they be and how well they perform this one be a de facto evolution to those phone it take awesome picture it be buttery smooth in term of speed the pen feature improve however it be smaller everyone be jealous because of the screen size and capabilities the only downside to the phone be the fact it be north of 1000 push towards the 1500 once you get the 512 gb storage the 512gb sd card insurance and an otterbox defender as a consolation prize amazon be cool to throw in one of those nifty 2nd gen echo plus that be tie into it as a promotion nobody come close as a promo item,samsung,1,1,0
1455,this phone be great very beautiful the ship be fast except i have to bug down dhl cause they keep delay custom and wont notify or tell you why no scratch or glitches that i can see so far come with plastic screen protector definitely need to get a case pretty happy,samsung,1,1,0
1456,the phone look amaze however the advertise 45w charge capability be mislead only able to achieve 33w max with original samsung 45w charger,samsung,0,0,1
1457,this version not dual sim but 4g version should come dual sim wow even samsung cheat us what i can say i be the stupid who leave apple to come to samsung,samsung,0,0,1
1458,upgrade to this phone from samsung galaxy s9 there be some stuff that i like and some other stuff i really hate okay here come the con first the onscreen fingerprint reader compare to my s9 fingerprint scanner the onscreen be trash very hard to read and even if i get it to read it take more time to unlock than the s9 iris scanner be go which be quite unfortunate due to the trash onscreen scanner the other part i dont like be the location of the power button the power button be now combine with the useless bixby and locate on the leave side right under the volume button i find it very hard to reach and sometimes get mix up with the volume button id rather have it on the right side the aux be now go too but not as much as a big deal for me i just hate to see it go the battery doesnt last as long as i would like it to be give i have to charge at least twice a day oh and one more thing the notification light be now go there be apps to enable light notification on screen but id rather have the lead than lead ring on my screen cause it might cause burnin in the long run okay now for the pros the screen size and color be outstanding bright and very pleasant to the eye the s pen be great to have but not really a game changer for me the screen be curve but not as curve as the s9 which i highly prefer because it be so much easier to put on temper glass the sd card slot be still present on the note 10 but it be also on the s9 speakers be decent nothing outstanding camera be okayish with additional wide angle camera the cut out camera be great than have bezels on top and bottom the aura glow color be amaze,samsung,0,0,1
1459,i want a dualsim version with the biggest possible storage and the product description say number of sim dualsim sim size nanosim 4ff sim slot type sim 1 hybrid sim or microsd this be false and mislead especially for a product that be ship from and sell by amazon the phone itself be great but i want a dualsim of it hence 3 star,samsung,0,0,1
1460,come defective,samsung,0,0,1
1461,ive have this phone for a little over a month now and i have to say its a very nice phone the screen be bright the camera be good and one ui somehow hasnt make me vomit bixby be also something you can just completely avoid theres build in win10 integration and the s pen be just awesome but the phone isnt perfect unfortunately the fingerprint reader isnt the best its slow and often fail to recognize my fingerprint especially if my finger be dry the lack of a 35mm jack hurt and ruin the no compromise feel that the absolute top samsung phone should have and their attempt to force samsung calendar down my throat be annoy to say the least all in all i would recommend this phone if youre will to sacrifice the 35mm jack for the s pen but at the same time i really expect a near perfect experience for 109999,samsung,1,1,0
1462,wrong description the phone be not a dual sim,samsung,0,0,1
1463,i absolutely love this device as a power user give me more than enough ram storage and process power ive always think that most smartphones be far overprice when compare to the cost of production its due to the amount of money that be spend on advertise that inflate the cost thats my only real complaint there be a lot of hide feature that come in extremely handy if you get this phone take your time and go through the settings and enable the feature that be best for you,samsung,1,1,0
1464,i purchase this phone after readingwatching many many review on you tube and the internet i choose this phone for several reason one it come with great memory right out of the box two no lag very speedy between apps three the stylus be great i love to write note and have extra feature build into the stylus be just a bonus finally the screen itself be just stun picture and movies be amaze on this display its large but not to large even with the phone protector a defender otter box on its really not that big and fit into my pocket easy i purchase additional memory for the already ample amount of memory that be on the phone already i just want to keep my book and movies separate the primary reason why i get this phone be to replace my old lg stylo 2 this be a large phone as well with a stylus it have only 16gb of memory i have this phone for several years and it still work fairly well however the battery be give out on it and the memory be less than adequate these be the primary reason to upgrade when i research this phone i want one that would last several years again and have the memory and speed to keep up with future apps and software update the note 10 plus just fit the bill,samsung,1,1,0
1465,galaxy note 10 plus be a great phone i love the phone but it be not what i expect i be expect a make in korea version instead i get a make in vietnam version disappoint as i ask the community they get the make in korea version i buy this phone for 1099 usd when i check the price after 1 week price go to 899 usd with a free samsung ear bud another disappointment package be also not reliable when i hold the package box i could feel the hollow ness inside no safety bubble wrap may be thats why there be these scratch on the box although phone be good but the deal i get be a total loss for me thats why only 3 star,samsung,0,0,1
1466,i normally don t buy flagship phone upon release but decide to get the note because i have never have the samsung note line but can use it s featuresfirst great thing be the s pen i have no problem figure out how to use this and now wonder how i ever live without iti much prefer use the pen to go though apps and i be actually the type of person who like to scratch out note on a piece of paperi just think it stimulate the think processand the pen be greatas far as no headphone jack i be wireless for so long now a cord just get in the way and win t miss it at all android 9 and samsung ui 15 be fine but the new update whenever it come make this phone probably the best android you can buythe photo proximity feature be really cool and useful for do projectsand the new update will finally get a worthy screen capture of recordingssomething need on the samsung line along with other improvementsi pair my phone with a gear s3 watch and this be probably the first time samsung have not abandon an older producti much prefer the samsung in style look and notifications along with exercise and pay be really my main watch thingsthe battery be excellentthe screen be amaze i don t even notice the little holeboth fingerprint and facial recognition have work well with me super happy with this phone and would recommend it as a work or personal phone to anyone in androidsamsung universethe smart switch from my s8 work very welland it isn t too big still fit in a pocket on a front shirt or in the pocket of my travel bag,samsung,1,1,0
1467,i pay 1100 for this and i still get bubble in my screen i open up the box and there be like carton piece on top of the phone and there be fingerprint all over the phone also why doesnt the screen protector cover the the entire screen kinda look like my screen protector isnt for the note 10 love the phone so far except for the bubble and how it be pack,samsung,0,0,1
1468,update phone be replace by a new one and it seem as work better and it be charge faster than the previous one i hope what i get be a great one i really love the feature of this phone it look and do what i great phone do it take amaze picture and the technology be amaze i be learn everyday new things and so far i love my phone the bad side be it charge so slow so i be not sure if it be the phone issue or the charger i dont know what i should do in this case i would have give 5 star but i be not happy with the time charge because it take forever as i say i dont know if this be the phone issue or the charger update i remove the screen protector that come with it as i get my own and surprise some scratch on the screen if i would have see those before i would have return it right away,samsung,1,1,0
1469,the good really nice design and great look phone probably the best hardware on any flagship phone at this time 112019 fullscreen bezeless large sturdy screen thats durable and the body be quite resistant to bend for a phone this size support add sd card storage of 1tab sdcards extend the 256gb 1tb total storage youll never have to worry about run out of room for photos and videos on your phone ever again 4k video slow motion and super slow motion video motion stabilization be really good snapdragon 855 processor mean its fast really fast nice stylus pen and can act as remote for some phone function like camera control it have a thin film screen protector instal by default you can set default storage of camera and download to sdcard and save your phone storage multitasking be very fast and very smooth wireless charge and wireless power transfer the bad the onscreen fingerprint reader suck it doesnt work with most screen protectors and even when it do it will fail at least 30 of the time and be exceedingly frustrate if you need to unlock the phone in a jiffy for photos or videos the facial recognition so fail about that much and if you change your hairstyle or wear glass and then stop it will not recognize you sometimes the facial recognition require good light or it will fail almost 100 of the time in the dark this mean if youre out on the streets or at a festival with minimal light it will not recognize your face it have a thin film screen protector instal by default that could interfere with additional screen protectors unless you remove it but youd have to know there be one in the first place which be not mention the default samsung camera software be inferior n picture take to even the pixel 3 camera i instal the google cam and use that instead of the samsung camera in normal photo situations the samsung cam over saturate and lose detail in photos where the google can will capture more realistic result with more detail and less photoshopped result that make the photos look almost fake the default samsung message app be also really bad it will compress any image and videos to such a degree that it will be totally blurry of you send things over sms it will also limit the size you can send beyond what other phone allow image you send will be subpar and pixelated i have to switch to the google messenger download from the play store it be superior in every way and i can send things over like i be able to on my iphone the quality be much better than the compress mess the samsung default message app be do the navigation swipe be hard to do sometimes due to the size of the screen and the keyboard layouts be not well design for one hand use even in one hand mode i have a much better one hand experience on my note4 this phone be near impossible to operate with just one hand most of the time the placement of the camera in the top leave corner mean when you try to take photos in landscape mode your finger can easily obstruct a portion of the camera and show up in your photos they shouldve keep it like the s10 where its in the middle of the phone so your finger would be a lot less likely to get in the way of the camera lense i havent own a note since the note 4 so for me this be a huge improvement in most areas and i be wait for a fullscreen bezeless phone with an onscreen fingerprint reader so thats why i choose the note 10 over the pixel 4xl i also want the flagship phone with all the bell and whistle so i choose it over the s10 i switch from a note to iphone and be piss at iphones limitations after 5 years mostly relate to storage and random apps disappear into icloud i decide i need to go back to android and be wait for the right phone i be overall very satisfy with the phone in the 600700 price range but wouldnt get it in the 1000 range due to some big flaw i mention above id buy this phone again in this price range because i still its great and in most ways its superior to the pixel and iphone but i think samsung couldve do much better on this phone especially since this be their flagship model oh also bixby be annoy and i turn that off right away if this be full retail of over 1000 id sadly go back to use an iphone or pay 600700 for a pixel 4xl,samsung,1,1,0
1470,like many of the others who like this phone we cant say enough about it either one note about it would be the importance of get all the samsung app update play store update and then finally the 2 major update for the android system and the final update to the 1st total up date will take about 12 hrs with 500mb connections the feature be by far to many to list here that make the apple i phone look like crap everything come in the box and it be a brand new phone we use teltik for all our business tmobile account so you might want to give them a look as the rat be the best in the usa you must at least have a business license to get those great rat however it have the full samsung warranty and we need some tech support with our account so samsung on the phone have us install the app smart tutor and remotely remodified our account with samsung and google while we watch them control the phone as if they be with us do it in our office amazon customer service in our opinion be one of the best and they wont stop work on a problem until its solve and or will replace your phone with a brand new one in 48 hrs lastly it be highly recommend to leave the factory glass protective cover on until you must replace it and protect your new samsung note 10 plus gem with an otter box case cover also available on amazon and elsewhere iphone users will never know what be miss the phone be unlock and its very fast with its snapdragon process unit again your not alone with samsung support and the real time remote access and service be amaze,samsung,1,1,0

1475,i do not do enough homework before purchase this i have terrible cell coverage at my house for all carriers im relegate to rely on wifi call to be able to send and receive call reliably from my house because this phone be unlock my carrier will not support wifi call even though they sell the exact phone and you guess it if you buy it from them wifi call work visual voicemail be something i like so i be very annoy to see that you also cant enable that clearly this be not a problem of the phone it point to the greed and control of the carriers out there if youre like me and must have wifi call then do not purchase an unlock version of the phone that say the note 10 plus be arguably the best phone ever so fast and so many great feature i love it,samsung,0,0,1

1478,i take point off because the phone essentially arrive as an open box and everything have be knock out of place inside that be purely against amazon for that not samsung despite this the phone itself arrive in new condition as for the phone itself overall 455 pros screen be beautiful and vivid phone be large but not uncomforable this be casebycase as i have large hand phone be extremely fast and responsive battery life be very good i dont need to charge my phone before i leave work anymore spen be a great addition and i love take note while the screen be off and lock con inscreen fingerprint scanner be not nearly as fast or reliable as the one normally on the back neither here nor there facial recognition can be dupe but i never use it as i prefer fingerprint readers because i dont want to pick my phone up every time i use it overall i be happy with the phone but not with amazon since somehow the sticker come off before or during ship allow everything in the box to move around,samsung,1,1,0
