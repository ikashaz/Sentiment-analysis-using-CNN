Ever since I switched to the P20 Pro from the Pixel 2 I've fallen in love with the P series phones and I won't be switching for a long time. The P30 pro is an amazing device and in my opinion unparalleled compared to the other flagship,huawei,1
Cool,huawei,1
"I love this phone. I also have a Note 8 comparatively. Macro, zoom and night shooting are unbelievable. I love being able to control my TV with the IR blaster too. Best camera ever",huawei,1
"No full support on T-Mobile’s network, missing bands 66 and 71, T-Mobile just flipped the switch in Chicago with its 71 band and oh boy! It really makes a difference. Not a 4K video, no a super screen like Galaxy phones, some pictures are different colors when taken with different lenses.a micro SD memory card? All for that amount of money? If you have a Galaxy or iPhone you are going to notice the big difference on emui(the skin on the android system, setting) that thing it is a punishment for you eyes, not even close to iOS or Galaxy plus the poor screen or low pixels density makes your eyes cry , if you want to add memory to it , will cost you around $45 for a nano 64g memory card, in areas where a Galaxy 10 plus tmobile has a download speeds of 45 Mbps this thing would give you around 15 Mbps , let alone where Tmobile phone can not get a decent signal. Indoor pictures a close range on people look terrible,it can not get the people's skin tone right, try the shoot a video using 4 k you will be so disappointed because again the colors look washed out.",huawei,0
"Really love this phone. I used to have 2 phones, one for Myanmar and one for US. Now with 2 Sims card, I can enjoy 2 in one. The phone is really light, amazing battery life. I use ATT Sim card for US with no issues.",huawei,1
"I only use a smart phone for phone and some message texting. I have no need for all Google apps. However, I have heard raving reviews about the P30 Pro's picture and video taking ability. I travel quite a bit, mostly overseas. Carrying even a small camera is a bit bulky. Also, when I go to concerts or jazz clubs at night, the camera's night photo/video taking capability is less than an iPhone. So, I bought this P30 Pro, highly recommended in reviews and by some of my friends. I have used it and it certainly performs to its acclaims and exceeds my expectations. I can carry it around in my pocket, very convenient. The triple lens can get a 3 dimensional image, incredibly sharp with depth. I have yet to try out the zoom feature. It is also rated high.",huawei,1

"live in Michigan, but not supported??? its weird. having trouble at times going back to main menu.",huawei,0
Nice phone!,huawei,1
"I was seriously considering the new i-phone but was really reluctant to pay a huge premium for a brand name and no memory expansion. It was with some reluctance that I ordered this P30-Pro. Having received and used it, I know I made the right choice.
I am running on T-Mobile. My area does not have the new bands so performance is essentially the same as on my old i-phone. Battery life is night and day. Even when new, my old phone struggled to make it through a full 24 hours. This thing just keeps going for 4 days.
Calls and audio work great. I disabled some of the Huwai features, interface is clean and easy to use. All of the apps are available in Play store and work great.
While I can not compare to the latest generation i-phone, I am really impressed with the camera. The zoom is an engineering marvel and night mode is stunning.
On a down note, It does use proprietary memory cards but, the good news is that those are available. I did order and install one, all good although more expensive than a standard memory card.
Only about a week into it but so far it is excellent. Will update if anything changes,",huawei,1
"Phone was returned.
Charger and adaptor received are not usable (different terminals) therefore you cant charge the $880 plus phone . Amazon should inform the seller about this. Saw one review with same issue.
Emails sent to me from NJ cannot be read. I live in NJ. Can't download music. I have a P10 pro and it works fine. Looks like the P30 pro's functionality was affected by Google's update. I still want to get one when the issue is resolved. I believe it is a better phone.",huawei,1
"I have owned a P20 Pro for about 14 months and that phone is amazing. Didn't really expect much of a difference with the P30 Pro, however, the look and feel of the P30 Pro is stunning, to say the least. Its front camera quality is mind-blowing (haven't explored the back). It's my greatest phone yet!!!!!",huawei,1

"Although the phone is something to behold, it is actually quite slippery in the hand. I did not receive the factory issued case in the box so I have to wait until the one I ordered arrives. The phone is a stunning upgrade from my Huawei P20 Pro. Slimmer, bigger screen. The new navigation gestures are a little hard to get used to at first as I am not using the onscreen gestures that are an option. The ""Night"" option in the camera takes spectacular low light photos. Out of the box, I received two updates from Huawei. Still waiting on 10.
Overall, would purchase again.",huawei,1
"iPhone better partner up with cannon or someone that knows about cameras because this thing is on fire !!
Android functionality sorth of sucks, but thats google haha, yet if you are looking for the best camera on a cellphone in the market this is it! Drop that old iPhone tech and feel this phone. Works amazing super fast and feels great!!",huawei,1
"I was a little hesitant reading all the other reviews about it not working in America, but I found it works great with Google Fi. Only thing is that my friends who have iPhone and I can't sent clear videos or pictures through SMS. I sync my phone number to my Hangout account and use that app to make calls and send messages. Camera is obviously advanced, so sometimes it more of a hindrance moving from iphone's ease of use. I think over time I'll get better at understanding all the advanced settings. Performance wise, this phone is great, fast load times and processing. Overall, very happy with my purchase.",huawei,1
Love it!,huawei,1
Super camera feature is the primary reason I bought this phone. I used it on my recent Europe trip and it really delivered. I am very pleased with the results. My pictures’ quality are comparable to my husband’s and my equipment costs 1/4 of his.,huawei,1
"I am glad that I didn't pay attention to the negative reviews. I would have missed out in one of the best phones I ever had. Once I got it, I just followed the instructions, put in the ATT sim and it was ready to rock. One unexpected benefit from this phone is the resection. it is way better than my old LGV40 and Samsung. All my friends are amazed by the picture quality. If you are in the states and not pressed to get on the 5G network, this is the phone to get until all the 5G hype settles and the prices go down.",huawei,1
"It's a great phone, looks nice, responds well, has a decent amount of features. The only problems I have so far is that the call volume always seems a little low compared to my old Galaxy phone, even if the volume max it out. It also doesn't seem to allow for expanded storage and has no audio port which means I cant hook it up to the non-bluetooth speakers in my car. Thankfully the phones built-in speakers work well enough to make up for that.",huawei,1

"I used to own the Google Pixel 3 phone and decided to switch to the P30 Pro, best decision ever. This phone an amazing camera, it's the best one on a phone I've ever used. Despite the ban on the U. S. android is still supported on the phone, which a huge relief I can use the Google assistant, Google maps, Google Play, ect. without any problems. It's such a beautiful phone, the color on the outside is gorgeous and I love the user interface of the phone. It was an expensive buy for me, but it was worth every penny, I absolutely LOVE this phone!",huawei,1
This by far is the things best phone out there right now. The camera is unparalleled beast. I also like the in screen fingerprint reader and EMUI gesture navigation. MUST BUY!!,huawei,1

"Amazing phone. The pictures are great, especially in the night and the battery lives for more than 2 days. The only bad thing is that you can not use all sim cards in the USA with this phone. But if you are ready to use the right sim card, you have to buy this phone!",huawei,1

🤔Recieved an empty box. Phone missing Unbelievable.,huawei,0
"I purchased this simply for the cameras and to that I am in love. As a phone though, it is a limited yet vanilla experience.
Chipset wise you will be hard pressed to find a faster Android on the market. It is blazingly fast and seems to retain it's speed overtime. Also to mention is the battery life which is somewhere between amazing and epic. The fast charging will put enough juice in the device in 30 mins to keep it powered for a day or so. This can be a bit troublesome though as it's fast speed and fantastic battery life are a result of aggressive task killing and limiting background processes. This frequently causes issues for some apps that are working in the background or even streaming audio. This can be remedied with exceptions but still worth mentioning.
2 sim cards can be used nativly and it is hands down the best software I have ever used for managing two sims. No other Chinese phones have come close to that level of plug and play with hot swapping sims.
The most exciting part though and exclusively what I paid for is the sensor and photo AI. The zoom is simply incredible. You will not believe it at first. It zooms optically for a very low noise zoom, pushing the limit triggers the AI which does a fantastic job of stabilization at up to 50X. It is even able to capture color and exposure accurately at range. The night mode is also incredibly powerful but demands a tripod or very steady hand. Essentially a long exposure but with the miracle of the sensor that somehow fills in the details at a level your eye can not even see.",huawei,1
Beautiful Chinese Phone,huawei,1
"The phone looks real cool, and works well enough, especially for the price. The worst and most frustrating part for me, is the processor. Sometimes the phone just takes a minute...",huawei,0
Very good cell phone . I use IPhone for 8 years.,huawei,1
"I bought it on ebay but the same phone. Great looking phone. camera appears to be producing good photoes. one thing i want to mention, with ATT, i can'T get wifi calling, which sucks because my house has terrible att signal. This is likely a restriction by att than by huawei, but Thought would point it out as it might apply to others who may also have poor att signal at home",huawei,0
Must better than iPhone. Got this phone for 1 month and I love it. It is the best phone you can ever get. The night vision for taking picture is awesome.,huawei,1
"best phone I have ever had, had a mate 10 pro, still run like a champ!",huawei,1
"I am a touch/feel person before buying.
What a Pity One Can’t Get His/Her Hands On This Beauty!
Free market economy? Who knows what that means these days.",huawei,1
Best phone ever. I was not expecting that high quality when I got the phone as a backup phone for my trip. But I love it more than my Samsung Galaxy S9,huawei,1
good,huawei,1
"I've been using this phone for 3 weeks. The most impressive thing about this phone in my opinion is not the camara. Don't get me wrong, the camera is as good as everybody else said. However, I don't think the image quality here can replace what I get from my DSLR or my mirror less. It's just above average when compare to other phones in the market and having full set of lenses that fits in my pocket is quite a new experience.
Now, back to what I love the most about P30 Pro, it's the battery. When I opened the box for the first time, the phone had 33% of battery. I received the phone at work around 10:30am and didn't have a chance to recharge it. I ran around all day that day and used the phone like usual, making calls, texts, emails, read documents, web search, GPS, etc. Only didn't have a chance to watch video or listen to music. By 9:30pm, 11 hours later, the battery went down to 1% and I just barely made it home. So, 33% for 11 hours with normal usage is pretty good for me considering my old phone can never last more than 4 hours in the same circumstance.
After the first day, I always start the day with 95-100% battery. My days normally start at 8:30am to 10:00pm. I've always come home with 40% left after 13.5 hours. This is definitely new to me. No more powerbank, no more looking around for an outlet to charge my phone, no more fighting over the charger with my wife and kids when we're outside, no more rushing to my bedroom to charge my dying phone when I get home, etc. I can use my P30 Pro as much as I like when I'm outside without worrying about putting the phone in battery saving mode. When I came home, now I can relax, sit in the living room a bit, spend time in the kitchen a bit. Unlike before that I have to run to my bedroom to charge my phone right away because it's about to die in 5 minutes. What a difference sensation.
Just an FYI, my old phone was a 2 years old Samsung with 3600mAh battery. My wife's is a year old iPhone that battery always run out at the end of the day. P30 Pro last all the way through the night.
The second best thing about this phone is the charger. I used Samsung all these years and very familiar with their fast charge. However, I've never seen anything like Huawei's Super charge. It's just crazy fast.
A lot of times at night, I went to bed and forgot to charge my phone. Woke up at 5:00am to realize it and start charging the phone. Usually, the phone has about 35% left. After taking shower and getting dress which took me about 20 minutes, once I'm done the phone will be charged up to 90% already. If I waited 15 minutes more, it'll go up to 100%.
Couple days ago, I spent a lot of time waiting for people so I watch a lot of videos to kill time. I used up the battery more than usual but still had 26% left by the time I got home. So, watch and stream video consumed more power but wouldn't completely drain out the battery of P30 Pro.
Enough with the battery, as I mentioned before, the camera is good for as long as you don't expect the full frame or APS-C quality. For smartphone, However, this is absolutely the best for still photos.
Video, unfortunately, is another matter. Although P30 Pro can shoot 4k but it's only limit at 30fps. If you're looking for a better video capability, Samsung S10+ is a better choice because it can shoot 4k60. The P30 Pro, on the other hand, is limit even at 1080p because it's only does 60fps while S10+ can go upto 1080p240. Big difference.
The screen is only full HD, not quad like S10+ but it's still AMOLED and looks good with every tasks. I have no complain about the quality of the screen. In fact, I already dropped this phone once in my garage, face down. There's no crack or scratch and still works perfectly fine so I know it's durable.
The Emui, I don't know why people complain so much about Huawei interface. Some people said it's look too much like iPhone with all the apps present on screen. Well, there's a drawer too if you choose to use it and make it feels more like Samsung. To me, there are some features I like that easier than Samsung and there are some features that's harder as well. No matter which phone you choose, it'll never be 100% perfect so why complain?
I will conclude my review here that this P30 Pro is one of the best in the market right now, especially the battery and charger. I might have something else to add but that'd be in the future.
Add comment 1: I was so busy lately and only have a chance to walk around a bit last night. So, I'd like to add some photos I took with P30 Pro. The first 3 photos just to show the difference between each lenses from wide angle to 10x zoom (actually, it's more like 16mm, 27mm and 270mm prime).",huawei,1
"Ever since the Huawei p20 pro I no longer consider apple in the mix. This phone is amazing, fast and the camera, the camera is like hollywood style, the low light pictures tuen out amazing, and it has a telescopic camera. ergo is great and it is dual sim, I use Att card in the USA and have chips for Canada Brasil and Mexico and the phone works great in all locations. While in the USA I use two seperate American chips one for work related item and my personal number. A fantastic feature is that both sims are 4g at the same time. In non Huawei phone you could only have 4g on one chip but not both at the same time. This phone allows both sim chips to run on 4g simultaneously. Battery life is Great. Crancks enough power that I can charge others people phones. This is an amazing phone and if you love pictures you wont find a better phone on the market today. With phone connectivity, I have not had an issue. The charger is fast in half hour it goes from 1% to 78% charged. My phone can handle water. I jump into the water of a beach in (phone went underwater) Brazil and no issue, The phone somehow knows how it is in water and protective features turn on. It included an earphone jack adapter for headphone thatnhave the traditional jack as well as a set of usb c head phones. Also one reviewer claimed it does not record in 4K, that is an untrue statement. It does record in 4k I attached a photo of the resolution selection page. the Default is FHD, for 4k you just have to select in the settings that you want to record in 4K. Great phone.",huawei,1

"This phone is fast processing, good quality camera, good battery and excellent design. I definitely recommend.",huawei,1
"This it’s a very strong phone! My friends and I purchase it as a gift for friend and he like it so much! He show us the camera zooming capability and I was stun by how far and clear it can go! Sadly it only work on T-mobile........ yes take note, only work on T-MOBILE CARRIER!!! The battery, the performance and camera it’s another level and you won’t go wrong having it!",huawei,1
"I like it very much, just upgrade from my old p9. The only downside is that the charger is not for US socket. A converter is needed if you want to use its 40w fast charging feature.",huawei,1
"This is honestly probably the best phone I've owned. I am so glad I didnt spend over 1k on an apple phone. Such a pretty and sleek design, the camera is absolutely amazing, and just overall a very convenient phone to use. It uses the Android system, which I was already kind of familiar with, and there are enough good things in this world to describe how AMAZING the battery life is.",huawei,1

"It's a good phone, but before you decide to buy it you would like to know this :
1 - It's slippery, you will loos it, order a flip cover to protect it and give you a good grip.
2 - It's a USB-C connector, so you can not charge or connect it with your old u-USB cable.
3 - You can not connect your lovely KOSS porta pro headseth, as there is no jack plug, unless you have a USB-C to jack adapter.
4 - If you don't have bluetooth in your car, there's no jack to connect the sound, unless you have a USB-C to jack adapter.
5 - The wide angle is nice, not a lot, but nice to have.
6 - The tele-zoom is nothing but impressive, and so are the low light capabilities.
Where most phones has a USB connector and a jack for the headseth, this phone has a USB-C connector that can connect a USB-C earpiece with microphone (included). So if you want to both charge and listen to music via a jack connector, you need a combined audio / USB splitter cable to do both at the same time.
Not staying with the standard solution here and keeping the audio jack is the only mistake they've made I think.",huawei,1
"We've had it for a few days and so far this is a great phone with an awesome screen and features, runs fast, looks nice, works with our network and you can't beat the price.
The phone is completely worth it the only thing I'm not completely in love with is the camera, is not bad it takes pretty good pictures but previously owned a zte axon 7 and the quality is lower on the Huawei Y9 which we don't mind honestly since this Huawei is not as expensive as the axon it is expected. But for the price is definitely a must buy we were weary of buying it because we saw a couple reviews and answers saying it might only take 2g or 3g but it received a 4g signal and everything works smoothly, we are currently using Cricket Wireless as our service provider. We had only purchased one phone to check if we like it and if it worked with Cricket and now we're ready to make another purchase because we loved it.",huawei,1
"This phone is exactly what I was looking for; A very large, bright screen, loud speaker (wish it had stereo speakers, but hey, no complaints here) and even with 3 gigs of RAM, it's still fast with the Kirin 710 processor. Also cames with Android Oreo out of the box. The Huawei cloud services that they offer isn't available in the US, but no big deal when Google keeps everything on their cloud. I did use the help app to ask some questions about settings and got answers back within in a few hours from Huawei's help team. Overall, a great phone at a great price. BUY IT!",huawei,1
"Closest phone to the Honor 8x which isn't released in the US. The screen is huge, very bright. The design is beautiful with blue backing, though which it was glass like the 8x. The phone is fast and snappy though ram management is aggressive and you will be reloading apps. The battery life is phenomenal, lasts 2 days sometimes. People tell me at times they call me but I did not receive call, if it wasn't for that I would give 5 stars.",huawei,1
"At this price point, you can't go wrong. This is a quality phone without doubt. Large screen with good color saturation and clarity. Good sound. A plethora of native settings to tweak the phone to suit your visual and performance needs. This is a not a Samsung Note 10! But for the features and performance at a little over $200, this ""beats the brakes off"" a phone that cost $600 more.",huawei,1

"I have been using smartphones since BB days from 2000.
The display, battery life, camera, speed exceptionally good. Comparable to iPhone X, my kids have it.
Bluetooth works with my speaker system as well the car, flawlessly
Few things would have been nice like power connector not so smooth, sometimes I get SMS messages few minutes late.
But the price is absolutely unbeatable. Display is like a white paper ( Kindle like)",huawei,1
"Love the phone, but can't give it 5 stars as I've discovered it's not eligible to register with cloud services. When you go to register it, it asks your country, and USA isn't a choice. I called support and they acknowledged that fact and said to transfer my photos, etc from my old phone I would have to install the app ""Phone Clone"" on both phones and go from there.",huawei,1
"Product was delivered precisely as described. The box was sealed after a fast delivery. After unboxing I was able to configure the language of the phone to my own language. Camera is pretty great and I can play smoothly games without lag. A micro simcard does not fit so I had to use a nano simcard. Now I can enjoy 3G, 4G and 4G+ in my country. Also a 3.5mm audio jack is great so I can listen to my favourite music.",huawei,1
"The operating system seems to work fast and fairly well. The only drawback is the battery life. If everything is turned on, the battery will run down pretty fast. I saw one guy on the web testing the battery life with the clock on this model. It's unbelievable.",huawei,1

"Works on LTE 2 and 4 bands with AT&T and T-Mobile in the USA. Just traveled by road from Oklahoma to Louisiana, Florida and Mississippi and back. I had coverage all through. Bought it from Amazon.

Love this phone. Super customizable. Has Huawei and Google store. Comes with a case and headphones! Color is super cute. And the battery last all day with heavy use. The camera is not the worst but wish it was better in low light. Of course it's a budget phone but well worth money paid. Face ID sensor works great. The only downside is no nfc which means no Google pay as it is in a low of Huawei phones.... Due to security reasons which could be bogus. But overall an awesome piece of equipment. fits 2 SIM cards and excpandable storage! Huge bright and crisp display. I really like this phone!! 🙌,huawei,1
Perfect,huawei,1
"Absolute crap. The front shooter is decent, but the back camera setup is terrible, the night mode and other camera options are trash, and I had high Hope's for the p30 lite, but it doesn't have correct fam bands, and with the old slow kirin 760, the camera, which was the selling point for me, just isnt nearly lgood enough to justify $350 midrange phones.
Pass on this, i went with p20 pro for 200 more, far superior product.",huawei,0

My support for Huawei is because I've been using this brand before and has a great quality at a fair price (not like other overpriced brands).,huawei,1
"I've used a 2016 Google Pixel for the past couple years and needed to upgrade when that phone recently died.
The P30 lite has a gorgeous screen with a tiny notch at the top - which I did not find distracting. The software is not stock android, but generally looked beautiful, functioned well, and had no bad habits. The software operates well and does a lot of thoughtful things that I appreciate.
The phone has a suite of ""built-in"" apps that you can delete, but they will only re-install themselves at the next Google Play update. Annoying. I don't know why phone makers still do this in 2019. This is more of a nitpick though.
What isn't a nitpick is the general sluggishness feeling of the phone. It feels slower than my 3 year old Pixel. Opening and closing of windows, zooming in on images, and just general operation feel less snappy than I would expect them to. Most people won't find this offensive, but if you're coming from a more powerful phone - even an older one - you'll notice it immediately.
For $270 its a great buy and for the price it would ordinarily be a five star phone. However given the alternatives, I'm afraid I have to ding it a star for the lack of speed. I'm returning mine for a Mi 9t.",huawei,1
really good,huawei,1
"I ordered this phone mainly for the dual SIM functionality. I won’t know how the dual SIM works until this November when I go to Asia. I will update the review when I have the first hand knowledge.
Thanks to Amazon Prime, I received the phone the day after I placed the order. There was a case and a screen protector included with the phone that were not mentioned in the product page.
I really like how the phone feels in my hand. It can be unlocked by fingerprint as well as the face recognition. So far, the battery life seems really good. Will update if there is anything worthwhile to mention.",huawei,1
"Everything is great except not supporting 5ghz WiFi. So if you care about the WiFi speed, then do not buy it.",huawei,1
Great phone. Upgraded from p20 lite which is also great. Bought 2 for me and my mom and we've never been happier,huawei,1
"We bought this phone for my brother in law. His iphone had been crack and he was looking for a long battery life cell phone. We had many colleage were using this phone. It had long battery life and large storage . And the price was very cheap. We got told the key board was little hard to use but it can set as Iphone mode. Then the keyboard's issue were solved. The only issue was when people try to send the message from iphone to this phone. Because he was using iphone so all the phone were sending the message as Imessage, so of it can not get through. We will keep updating the issues. But after all, it was a great phone as 200+.",huawei,1
"I needed a replacement phone, due to a swollen battery on my Huawei Mate SE (I discovered overcharging a cell battery increases gasses in the battery from a phone tech, so don't leave your phone constantly charging, folks). I could have had the battery replaced by a tech for $55, but decided to treat myself to a slight upgrade. I was very happy with the Mate SE, so I went to Youtube for reviews of Huawei phones. After seeing a number of very favorable reviews of the P30 Lite, I ordered this phone late last Saturday, and received it the following Monday.
I had debated spending $500 or more for a ""high end"" phone, but learned a lot of the technology in more expensive phones is dedicated to photo-taking technology. I'm not a selfie-addict, so I let common sense take over, and opted for a phone in the $300 range (I found a vendor that sold this phone for $259, and 2 day delivery- I didn't want to wait a week in the event my old phone died).
The phone comes with the described accessories- USB-C cord, screen protector, charging brick, and a very thin, rubberized case. The phone is very sleek and slippery. I'd suggest putting the case on immediately, so it doesn't slide out of your hand. I originally placed it on a glass table top, and it slid all over the place.
The phone has a massive 128 gig internal storage capacity. I put a 128 gig SD card in the 2nd slot. I can't imagine what I'd fill the phone with, but I think most of us have discovered over time that we tend to fill our phones up with pics and music. I'll have plenty of room to download Netflix vids to watch when I'm on a treadmill.
Out of the box, the phone was charged to about 56%, and was loaded with Android version 9.
The on speaker at the bottom is very loud. I tend to link to a bluetooth speaker or headphones for music and videos anyway. I haven't tried a phonecall on speakerphone yet.
The phone seems only able to pick-up the 2.5 Ghz channel on your wireless network.
Exporting all my apps and settings from my old phone to the P-30 was almost seamless, using Huawei's Phone Clone app (you can obtain it in the Google Play Store, for your old phone). This turns both phones into hotspots, and you keep both phones close to each other, and 99% of my apps and settings were exported.
By default, ALL your apps will be displayed over multiple screens. I thought I would have to spend hours arranging my apps, but discovered the setting (see attached pic) for ""Home screen style"" under Settings>Home screen & Wallpaper>Home Screen Style> then select the bottom choice, ""Drawer."" This brought almost all my app icons I had from my old phone, where I nested similar apps in their own ""drawers"" labeled ""music,"" ""tools,' etc. This saved me HOURS of work. All your apps will now be in a drawer that looks like a circle with 3 rows of 3 dots. You can then drag whatever apps out, and align them how you wish. If you drag one app into another, you create a- I think they're called ""drawers"" which you can then label. This helps categorize apps.
""Ease of use"" is relative. If you're new to the Android world, going through all the settings can be daunting, and there's LOTS of settings under the hood. I'm still discovering many. I appreciate built-in apps, like App Lock, which enables you to protect your apps like email, and banking by preventing use by other people. You unlock the app either by your fingerprint, or passcode.
I enabled fingerprint and facial recognition to unlock the phone. The responsiveness is instantaneous. One trick with the fingerprint scanner on the rear of the phone: when looking at pictures, you can use a finger to swipe to the next picture, so you can view a gallery of of photos with one hand, instead of two.
There is a notch at the top of the phone, which can be hidden via settings.
I find the camera much faster than my old phone, and more variety in how to take take photos. The photos are crisp, and capture colors fairly accurately. Are they iPhone quality pics? No. The camera isn't a big deal for me, but it's nice to have a camera that takes good quality photos. The digital zoom works very well. Sending pics via MMS seem fine to me, unlike another reviewer.
There's no native internet calling feature, but there's 3rd party apps that support that (but you will be issued a new phone number).
Scrolling is fast and smooth.
I found one little quirk: When viewing Youtube, the video is about 20% smaller than the screen. You can go fullscreen using your thumb and forefinger to stretch to fullscreen. It may be a power saving feature; I'm not sure.
Huawei is known for its extremely long power use. You'll have to experiment in Settings to find the one right power setting for you.
There's plenty more features to be discovered, but at this price point, this phone is a winner.",huawei,1
Espectacular phone! Speaker volume could be a little louder but I would definitely buy it again.,huawei,1
"five star for huawei, i will stick to this brand, it s great value for this price, powerful cameras , long lasting battery life, fast system, all i m asking for is inside of this phone",huawei,1
"It came on time and perfectly package, at first glance out of the box u can tell its new brand and in very good condition. It came with a case and a screen protector which was plastic but I can't complain bcuz it's something to get u started until u buy a better one. It's much lighter than I expected and much more beautiful in person. They also include a ear plugs and a charger which was all neatly packed in the box. Overall I am pleased.",huawei,1

This phone does not support 5ghz wifi,huawei,1
Camera takes amazing shots. Battery life is great. The only issue I have is during call I go client every 30 seconds or so for 5-10 seconds and it is very aggravating. Returning it back. I'm on T-Mobil but myballnorevious phones worked well with original sim card. Antenna or phone itself is defective. Otherwise I'd voted 5 star,huawei,1
"This is my 4th Huawei phone. P8, P9, P20 lite, and now P30 lite. Not much difference between the P20 and P30 except the P30 has a better camera, a bit bigger and best of all has better accessibility functions.",huawei,1
Excellent phone!,huawei,1
"I really enjoy all the things this phone does. However my calls keep dropping. I'm with metro pcs by T mobile. None of my other phone calls dropped with metro with a metro phone. However the features on this phone are great, screen recording is a feature that I really enjoy. The fingerprint feature is on point and is one of the main reason I bought the phone. The size of the phone is perfect for my hands, nice and slim, that way I can I use 1 hand. Only thing I have to say I don't like is the damn calls be dropping like crazy.",huawei,1
"It doesn't have wifi calling which I depend on a lot, but it does connect to tmobil network better than an iPhone. And everything else is good",huawei,1
"This phone has met my expectations thus far. I needed a cheap but dependable phone, and I think this phone meets that need. It is very lightweight. My husband has a similar Huawei that is a few years old and his phone is much heavier. However, the weight doesn't seem to indicate that the phone is cheap by any means. It holds battery well, charges extremely quickly, has decent sound quality for shows and movies, and take better pictures than my last phone did. The pictures are really good, but using the zoom is tricky as zoomed pictures generally come out blurry (but maybe it's just my shaky hand). The fingerprint sensor works perfectly. The phone seems intuitively designed. It is easy for me to navigate through apps and change settings. My only complaint is that I have a problem with calls dropping in areas where they didn't previously. However, I recently changed my service provider, so I have no way of knowing if the drop issue is related to the new phone or the new service provider. Overall, not a bad buy...Would buy it again.",huawei,1
"Most for your $$!
Im a fairly heavy phone user and I regularly go two days without charging. Solid processor (has some issues w snapchat sometimes) its fast, impressive screen. Camera has a lot of pixels but there aren't utilized that well by the OS, but I still get some solid pics out of it.",huawei,1

"Huawei evolved having these phones to compete in big leagues. Fast, excellent features and cheap compared with other brands.",huawei,1
"I couldn't be more disappointed with this phone. I am coming to this adter two years of using a $50 blu phone which worked great. Now this ""nice"" (read: expensive) one had a vertical line of dead pixels within one week of purchase and now, four months later, the audio jack stopped working. What a tremendous disappointment. And to make matters worse, the camera that's supposed to be so amazing, is pretty lousy and can't zoom while maintaining quality at all",huawei,0
"the phone overall it ok, note that this phone has no 5ghz wireless ability.
and my phone i recieved, while on a call will cut out for about 30 senconds mutiple times and its very frustrating.
the speed and functionally is really amazing it feels like a flag ship iphone X or samsung 10
other than no 5ghz wireless and the phone call issue this phone is great.",huawei,1
"For the price you won't find anything better. Three years ago, this would have been a flagship phone. The only thing that could be better is the camera. Compared to my P30 Pro that blows away any Samsung, Iphones, Pixels that I compared side by side with, this P30 lite's camera quality is probably equivalent to an Iphone 5. But I guess if they included a better camera, there would be no profit.",huawei,1

"Although the box was a little dirty making afraid of what I was about to receive, it was the total opposite.
The phone was and IS brand new, works perfect and EVERYTHING works as it should. 100% recommended.",huawei,1
"This phone has a lot of language options which was important to me.It has an easy menu. I liked the colors on the screen. I bought this phone for my dad as a present. The sound was coming out loud,which is very important for him. I really like everything beside camera. It’s not of the best quality. The pics were little blurred compared to my iPhone. Pictures are not that important for my dad as for me. So I give this phone 4 stars.",huawei,1
"Terrible experience. After one week of buying this phone, the apps until today keep crashing.
I contacted Huawei and the warranty that lifeline786 provides is not issued by Huawei, I have contacted Huawei about it with my model number and in their customer service webpage. It says international warranty but they do not specify of covers US and Canada, I live in the US and Huawei canot help me with technical support or any other service.
The phone has perfomed 2 factory resets on its own!!! Putting everything back together after 15 minutes. Do not buy this model if you live in a country with winter. This version does not support glove mode.",huawei,0
"Overall,It is a good mid range smart phone at this price.Big screen,fast charging and nice cameras both rear and front.But battery is draining very fast and battery capacity is not enough as described.About 5 hours for screen on time.Disappointed!",huawei,1
I bought this for grandson number two. It is an excellent phone though it has a quirk about finding and connecting to wi-fi. Sometimes it will not show the same SSID's my OnePlus does. I assume it is some firmware or adapter difference. Other than that the fine is fantastic.,huawei,1

"Bought this phone to replace a Samsung Galaxy Avant which was 6 years old. I had to charge it twice a day, had no memory /storage and lost apps because phone was out of date. The Huawei P30 lite is so awesome, it's fast, has plenty of storage and so far I only have to charge it every other day. I love it!",huawei,1
"Pretty good phone, camera is much better than my iphone 6 on the sharpness of the photo quality. If it can zoom at least 15x instead of 6x, I would love it even more (I know the Pro version is 60x zoom, lol)",huawei,1
Great phone lighting speed,huawei,1
"Don't buy this phone it's soo disappointing, even for the price. I initially was hopeful as I'd read alot about Huawei's technology but I find myself constantly frustrated with this phone. The camera's quality is shocking considering it has 3 cameras and the phone is honestly so glitchy. I often have to retype messages or re-perform actions as the phone just decides it's going to return to home screen without warning. I won't be using this phone by this time next week. Dont' waste your money.",huawei,0

"I have a doubt. I have read in several official Huawei publications and they stated that the Huawei P30 Lite has 3 rear cameras with the following characteristics 48 + 8 + 2MP, in your publication says the resolution is: 24 MP + 8 MP + 2 MP.
Which one is correct?",huawei,0
What the hell?,huawei,0
Good everything is excellent,huawei,1
The phone came in spanish and I looked for usa it was not there I got the international phone and it was plastic not glass and light weight I had the huawei mate 10 pro but it came to me broken but what a difference the mate 10 pro was amazing. This phone I never used more than 2 minutes it went right back to ups as soon as it went back in the box.,huawei,1
Thought the camera would be better. It is still a great phone. Doesn't have password not draw pattern to unlock,huawei,1
charge phone look new charging issue second day using phone wont charge charger sent phone keep receiving message accessory may supported whenever plug really disappointed,Iphone,0
She particularly loves how well the selfie camera seems to make her look. Smh things that women find important.,huawei,1
"My old phone with 16 gb worked very well for me last three years, but my usage started to demand more storage. The price is right for this 128 gb phone. I had it for one day now. Overall, I am quite happy with it. The lag time doing in negotiation is quite negligible to me and flow is quite smooth. I do not know how good the camera is, although the few pictures and videos I took were quite acceptable. I generally used a Canon SLR camera for photos, and this is just to be used for quickie and convenient use only. It did not detect my 5g or AC wifi, but somebody in the review has always pointed out, so it is within my expectation. Using speedtest with 2.4ghz wifi, I got 74.7 mbps download speed. I am not sure if it is just my cloud content or it is Google problem, but I like to warn that if you Google backup to install all the apps previously installed in the other phone, it created a display sleep problem. The phone would go to sleep every eight seconds if there was no activity, no matter what battery performance or sleep timeout setting I changed to. I had to solve the problem by resetting the phone to the original factory setting and reinstalling each application manually one by one through the play store. I got the solution from other users in the internet having the similar problem with Huawei phone and other brands phones so this maybe a common problem with the Google backup. Likely, it could be the content stored in this backup, but I do not care to find out as I do not have the problem any more. It also seems that I have an easier time to synchronize the windows 10 contact and calendar apps through the outlook.com with the phone built-in contact and calendar apps, than my old phone. It took me about three hours to re-install all the apps, about 40 of them and to complete the email, contact and calendar setups.",huawei,1
"I was one of the last holdouts with a windows phone, and knew I had to buy something to replace it. I had android years ago, so I thought I would just go back to it, plus apple doesn't make products in this price range really. My biggest fear was trying to transfer data, and it did prove to be trying and not completely successful. Got photos, music (had to buy a converter from wma to aac format) and my ringtone ok. Only got sms texts transferred using an app, but lost my mms and contacts. Oh well, I just made do. I am a very light smart phone user so..... not a big deal.
This phone itself, I really like. Ultimately popped in the sim card from windows phone and this one took off. Screen is great for me, I got my apps loaded and I am very satisfied with this phone. Photos are certainly good enough. I cannot seem to figure out how to get a shadow screen to open up when I take it out of my pocket, I always have to push the button. Probably a security thing. I don't use the fingerprint scanner, opted out of that so I cannot comment on it. Like that it has a headphone jack, and I added a 128 sd card.
I am a light user of this phone. I am not on it constantly. Probably twenty texts a day, the occasional phone call, some news reading, etc. So far the battery has lasted days for me. At least 3, and I was still at 40%. I turn off location, bluetooth and notifications since I don't use them daily and I am sure that helps with the battery.
This phone is faster than my nokia windows phone (950) which was one of their better phones at the time. For under $300 I think this is a fantastic phone. My understanding is that this phone will be supported into the future, even if Huawei is banned from Google support, as a kind of grandfathering for products already in consumer hands. It is a pretty phone (peacock blue) and feels solid to me. I wouldn't hesitate to buy another.
UPDATE 8/27/2019 As this is an international version, the android stuff is not as up to snuff as getting a US Version phone from ATT. One thing that I noticed after some use which bugged me, is that the resolution of the attached photos I would send in the messaging app was very poor. Blurry and no detail, it really toned down the resolution. The answer was to change messaging apps from the stock android to something else. I tried TEXTRA, and voila, the photo resolution improved immensely. Problem solved.",huawei,1
I really like this phone. The features on this phone are pretty cool. I love the phone clone app that allowed me to download my call logs and text messages from my old phone. Also I have AT&T service and I did not need to call AT&T to activate my phone I just put in the SIM card and the phone worked. I like the features of the scrolling screenshot and the time limit that you can set on screen time. the camera on this phone is much better then the camera on my LG Stylo 4 I had previously. However the camera is not as good as my husband's LG G5. Setting up the fingerprint scanner was easy and fast and I like that it allows me fast access to the phone. Overall I am giving this phone 5 stars. also as a side note the case and screen protector that is included with the phone and the headphones are not the greatest quality but they are good enough to get you started and hold you over until your case arrives. I ordered a love mei case to go with this phone and it is an excellent fit.,huawei,1
Best performance at the best price.,huawei,1
This phone is wonderful. It unlocks via fingerprint faster than any phone i've ever held. Load of space as well,huawei,1
Great batt life and fullest clearest screen I have ever had. Response time is very good with a excellent amount of memory 128 GB holds all my music and photos. Great phone at a great price. Much better than the NOVA 3i that I returned.,huawei,1
"I bought two phones to compare one was p30 lite another one pixel 3xl . Pixel cost around 400$ and p30 lite 260-290$. In my opinion pixel won( camera resolution, screen, google storage, google services).
FYI
Network test T-mobile.
The biggest disappointment was that p30 lite 4G LTE test was 2-3x less that pixel 3 xl. p30 lite-on the T-mobile network gets 4-8mbps and pixel 3xl around 20-25mbps.
P30 lite not bad phone if you compare phones under 300$.",huawei,0
"False name, Huawei nova4e lied Huawei p30, deceptive behavior",huawei,0
"I bought this phone and discovered that this particular variant sold does
not have 5 Ghz wifi support. I decided to return it. This is a great phone
but the lack of 5Ghz wifi is a deal breaker. You are warned. Note that I
did talk to a Amazon customer service person and she confirmed that after
checking with Huawei. BTW, the official LX3A model specs appeared to list 5Ghz
wifi support, but it appeared that variants of this model sold for certain countries
like Brazil and Canada do not have 5Ghz capability.",huawei,1
"Didn't like the plastic body. Looks cheap and feels cheap in my hand. Get the honor or nova made way better I don't like the charger. I like that the phone is fast, picture quality is outstanding for a budget phone, and it wakes when picked up.",huawei,1
I previously lost my huawei y9 2019 phone. I purchased a replacement that was cheaper but the thing irritated me because it lagged badly. I purchased this phone and I love it. Takes me right where I need it without lagging. Just a great phone. After my first huawei I'm definitely a big fan,huawei,0
"Even though this model has 4G ram only, the performance is supra. The face recognition and finger print lock is 2 generations ahead of Samsung, and the over all experience is much better than iPhone. And it is very cool to have a phone that's almost banned. It will become a must-have for the underground community.",huawei,1
"I had old Nexus P6 for 3 years the performance is slow and the battery sucks. So i was very hesitate to buy another Huawei phone. But for $320 for this unlocked P30 lite, nobody can beat this price. I used the phone for 3 weeks now and it is AWESOME. The pearl blue is shining and outstanding. Migrating the data from my old phone to new phone is fairly easy. The battery life is just unbelievable. I using all day and it only consumed 30%. Tons tons of other features to be explored. But I like this phone!",huawei,1
"Love the phone and after having galaxy s6, s7edge, s8, s10 I would pick another Huawei over a Samsung any day. I don't have to clean my phone or clear cache's nearly as often and never seem to get any type of virus's. Also the screen is still in tact after 6mos. which says a great deal about it as I do construction and it doesn't matter what type case's I've had I have broken all of my screens. I bought a cheap case with this phone and screen protector and have dropped it too many times and it's been a real trooper. I just like everything about the phone better than the Samsungs & LG's I've had in the past. Thanx Huawei and Amazon",huawei,1
I know this is a cheaper version of the P30 pro but come on at least make the Wifi good. I relalized that their products dont have the ability to connect to 5ghz wifi networks. They only connect to 2.4ghz wifi networks. So if u only have 5ghz networks then this might not be that good of a phone. The fingerprint reader is indeed pretty quick but the battery life is lacking. I had their mate 10 and the battery last way longer than this product. I thought it would be better and last longer but i was wrong. Overall this is a 6.5/10 phone for its price. The camera was not as good as my mate10 pro.,huawei,1
"What a wonderful phone, the fingerprint reader is awesome. A huge upgrade from my previous phone, so far I have not had any technical issues with my phone, everything seems to be working smoothly. I really love the storage capacity. Best of all is the camera.",huawei,1
Buy it,huawei,1
Just switched from iPhone to Huawei. Everything sounds good with AT&T. Will update later.,huawei,1
"Great storage space. Beautiful camera. Unlocked, works for T-Mobile. Great phone for a cheap price. Battery lasts for about 2-3 days depending on usage. Bright screen. Pictures are great and sharp, especially when you have good lighting to assist you.",huawei,1
"Support dual sim cards, long battery life, excellent camera(s), bright screen, a good speaker that can fill a room with sound and everything from an android system. What else do you expect?",huawei,1
Fantastic to look at & use. Took 5 minutes to transfer my data from the old phone to Huawei P30 (just download Phone Clone app by Huawei) eezy-peezy! Just plugged in my T-mobile sim card and there my new phone is rolling... :) Decent photos too. Really nice color too (peacock color) with free transparent case. JGM Star is a very good seller!,huawei,1
"bought for my wife, now i'm jealous. I wish it would have wifi calling option, then i would buy it for myself, but i work in a bunker, so have to use stupid samsung",huawei,0
got mom problem far almost 2 month,Iphone,0
Ok,huawei,1
So cool and fast delivery,huawei,1
"I have 4 months with the equipment and for 1 month the equipment has been heated with daily use and when I put it to charge the battery, I do not understand why this happens, the charger is the original with which I bought it and does not use the team for long hours and still heats up",huawei,0
"Product info as advertised, like the screen resolution",huawei,1
I bought this phone and it does not work nearly anywhere in the states. Do not buy if you live in US. I've had other Huawei and honor phones that worked fine but this one doesn't work nearly at all.,huawei,0
Phone is great if you don't need to connect to 4G Internet.... Or any I ternet for that matter. Can't message or receive messages while away from home or not actually signed into someone's network. Useless really. Keyboard is made for hobbit fingers.,huawei,0
"Excellente phone for the price. A lot of space for applications and pictures. I'm able to play call of duty mobile without any problems. Picture quality is excellent, sometimes it lags but not a big deal.",huawei,1
Picked this up for the girlfriend! She loves it and loves the fact it doesn't look like everyone else's and is unique and it works flawlessly. Great camera and great reception and battery life!,huawei,1
Shipped with open box item. see photos.,huawei,0
"I can only say, I have no reason to go back to Samsung Motorola or Apple. Packed with features you will only get flagship phones from other companies. the only con I have; built-in battery",huawei,1
The color is so pretty. Got this for my mom because her old phone‘s battery was dead. This smart is pretty cool and worth the money :) the price is cheap but the quality is really good！highly recommend.,huawei,1
Just so well designed. Lot of storage too. Fast!,huawei,1
The only reason I didn't give it a five-star is because I am not very good at reading fine-print and this doesn't use any of the main carriers it works for services like boost,huawei,1
"Very good phone all round but the camera is just ok and the speed is just ok.
I traded up for a pixel 3a and an quite happy but if you prefer a better looking phone this is it",huawei,1
I have the phone for over a month now and I have no complaints. The picture quality is good for the price. I charge once per day (watch a lot of YouTube in between charge). The finger print reader only allow 1 finger. It would have been nice if I could have the option to code another finger but I guess the face recognition makes up for that,huawei,1
"What can I said? Just $280 got the wonderful phone. Whatever battery, screen resolution or the camera all better than Samsung. So valuable cell phone.",huawei,1
"This phone keeps dropping calls and cutting out for 5-10 seconds when in use. When you call someone sitting right next to you, or have them call you, the call will not go through. Return to sender.",huawei,0
"Got this phone because I had heard the camera was amazing, after using it for a month or 2 I can definitively say that the camera is not that great.",huawei,0
"Best phone I've ever owned, picture quality is great, so is the battery life, easy to operate, I was leary on buying a different Brand, but I love this Hauwei phone, would recommend it to anyone looking to purchase a phone.",huawei,1
Gave it as gift for my wife! Loves it!,huawei,1
know use phone price 700 look bad condition unfortunately take risk buy phone able see used happy purchase,Iphone,0
It was a cool device. I've got alot of respect for huawei. But this device was just to small and light compared to my OnePlus devices. Downgrading due to shattered back of my OnePlus 7 pro and financial woes.,huawei,0
I like this phone the camera is very good and very useful for me and the stuff is awesome just I can't see the pattern password system but I'm in love 😍 with it,huawei,1
abs value and worth the money... some feature has treat off for performance and resolution...,huawei,1
"I actually bout two for my family. The Huawei phones ta much, much better pictures than any phone out there. I own all Huawei phones and they are the finest phons out there no questions asked. The usgovernment has a very stupid position on these remarkable phones",huawei,1
"This phone feels good in the hand and looks nice with its display but do not be fooled by the triple camera set up, very poor quality in all settings. The glass back gives a nice flagship phone feel but stear clear of this model because it's absolutely worthless with the camera. Very disappointing especially coming from Huawei",huawei,1
"Fingerprint sensor is so incredibly fast. The cameras take beautiful, crisp pictures. In extremely pleased and would definitely recommend to anyone wanting Android OS with a screen that is big and bright for a low price.",huawei,1
I love this phone only complaint I have is I thought the display quality especially for videos would be a lot better too pixelated! 2nd the camera is decent biggest complaint NO NFC! And lastly when capturing screenshots they come out really blurry same for the video recording other than that pretty decent phone for the price,huawei,1
I like it! its a cool cell phone,huawei,1
Very nice phone and the best price,huawei,1
Good buy!,huawei,1
"Great smart phone. Great quality, great price.",huawei,1

I love this phone. I purchased it a month ago. So far I am really happy with it. The phone is very fast and user friendly with long lasting battery and nice quality camera. I can't say anything negative about it.,huawei,1
Bought this for my husband & he is loving every bit of it .,huawei,1
"I got the phone for my girlfriend because she hates iPhones, she loves this phone, just as hi tech as the iPhone and a way better camera. Super clear and with great definition,I would definitely recommend this phone to fam and friends",huawei,1

Have used the phone for a few weeks. Overall very good and met the expectations. Decent battery life and screen.,huawei,1
For the money you pay it is good phone. One very disappointing item is this phone does not support 5Ghz wifi.,huawei,1
to bad there isn't Wi-Fi calling this phone would be perfect for kids as its cheaper than most phones,huawei,1
Great phone,huawei,1
Great Deal = Great Product,huawei,1
This would be a great phone for that price with truly amazing feature...…...if only it worked for more than a few months. The screen suddenly froze and the phone is now stuck on a bootloop for no reason. Had two Huawei before and this never happened.,huawei,1
Good,huawei,1
"So far this is a amazing phone experience, really enjoy the camera. Only downside is there is no NFC so I can't use Google pay.",huawei,1
"The details should have indicated that 5GHz is not supported. Other than that, the phone works fine. The camera has very good quality.",huawei,1
Excellent phone,huawei,1
Great products. Cheap price,huawei,1
"We've had it for a few days and so far this is a great phone with an awesome screen and features, runs fast, looks nice, works with our network and you can't beat the price.
The phone is completely worth it the only thing I'm not completely in love with is the camera, is not bad it takes pretty good pictures but previously owned a zte axon 7 and the quality is lower on the Huawei Y9 which we don't mind honestly since this Huawei is not as expensive as the axon it is expected. But for the price is definitely a must buy we were weary of buying it because we saw a couple reviews and answers saying it might only take 2g or 3g but it received a 4g signal and everything works smoothly, we are currently using Cricket Wireless as our service provider. We had only purchased one phone to check if we like it and if it worked with Cricket and now we're ready to make another purchase because we loved it.",huawei,1
"This phone is exactly what I was looking for; A very large, bright screen, loud speaker (wish it had stereo speakers, but hey, no complaints here) and even with 3 gigs of RAM, it's still fast with the Kirin 710 processor. Also cames with Android Oreo out of the box. The Huawei cloud services that they offer isn't available in the US, but no big deal when Google keeps everything on their cloud. I did use the help app to ask some questions about settings and got answers back within in a few hours from Huawei's help team. Overall, a great phone at a great price. BUY IT!",huawei,1
"Closest phone to the Honor 8x which isn't released in the US. The screen is huge, very bright. The design is beautiful with blue backing, though which it was glass like the 8x. The phone is fast and snappy though ram management is aggressive and you will be reloading apps. The battery life is phenomenal, lasts 2 days sometimes. People tell me at times they call me but I did not receive call, if it wasn't for that I would give 5 stars.",huawei,1
"At this price point, you can't go wrong. This is a quality phone without doubt. Large screen with good color saturation and clarity. Good sound. A plethora of native settings to tweak the phone to suit your visual and performance needs. This is a not a Samsung Note 10! But for the features and performance at a little over $200, this ""beats the brakes off"" a phone that cost $600 more.",huawei,1
I dislike the fact that the ID I'm supposed to use with the phone isn't even available where I registered the phone.,huawei,0
"Absolutely, worth buying. Phone has a smooth processor at that and runs very smoothly. It even has 64GB in internal storage who can beat that, and it's Dual Sim Card along with ability to take moving pictures. An option not available on the Huawei Y7 2019. I absolutely prefer the Huawei Y9 2019 over the Huawei Y7 2019.
Your videos show clear as daylight, I'm able to stream videos at 1020p now! I wasn't able to on the Huawei Y7 2019, now I can 😁. I'm definitely glad I made the switch.
I totally give this phone a rating of 5 stars. The processor and overall performance of this phone up there with phones that range between $500-$800. Definitely recommended individuals to purchase this beautiful device.
Sidenote: I bought my Huawei Y9 2019 in the condition of Used Like New and boy this phone has no issues whatsoever or blemishes.",huawei,1
Very poor phone... Battery is no good... Screen got freeze it self....don't buy it.... And I don't want your Refund..... Keep it for your self....,huawei,0
This hone was bought for my 9 year old sister. For the price it performs extremely well. Design is sleek and classy. Screen is big and bright. Speakers are quite loud.,huawei,1
Perfect! Quality of the thousand dollar phones for way less.,huawei,1
"I have been using smartphones since BB days from 2000.
The display, battery life, camera, speed exceptionally good. Comparable to iPhone X, my kids have it.
Bluetooth works with my speaker system as well the car, flawlessly
Few things would have been nice like power connector not so smooth, sometimes I get SMS messages few minutes late.
But the price is absolutely unbeatable. Display is like a white paper ( Kindle like)",huawei,1
"Love the phone, but can't give it 5 stars as I've discovered it's not eligible to register with cloud services. When you go to register it, it asks your country, and USA isn't a choice. I called support and they acknowledged that fact and said to transfer my photos, etc from my old phone I would have to install the app ""Phone Clone"" on both phones and go from there.",huawei,1
"I haven't even gotten to setting this phone up, I just had to post about what a surprise opening the box was! Included were a case, screen protector, a sim port key, charger, an American wall plug and earbuds!!! Holy cow! Such bang for the buck! I am truly impressed. I will never buy ""American"" again.",huawei,1
"Product was delivered precisely as described. The box was sealed after a fast delivery. After unboxing I was able to configure the language of the phone to my own language. Camera is pretty great and I can play smoothly games without lag. A micro simcard does not fit so I had to use a nano simcard. Now I can enjoy 3G, 4G and 4G+ in my country. Also a 3.5mm audio jack is great so I can listen to my favourite music.",huawei,1
"The operating system seems to work fast and fairly well. The only drawback is the battery life. If everything is turned on, the battery will run down pretty fast. I saw one guy on the web testing the battery life with the clock on this model. It's unbelievable.",huawei,1
Love the phone but my main issue is. Can anyone get straight talk working on this phone in u.s if so plz plz help with getting service. P.s i hve tried bootloader not working. Cant figure out how to get verizon off dis phone.,huawei,1

Nice phone 👍,huawei,1
Love this phone. Super customizable. Has Huawei and Google store. Comes with a case and headphones! Color is super cute. And the battery last all day with heavy use. The camera is not the worst but wish it was better in low light. Of course it's a budget phone but well worth money paid. Face ID sensor works great. The only downside is no nfc which means no Google pay as it is in a low of Huawei phones.... Due to security reasons which could be bogus. But overall an awesome piece of equipment. fits 2 SIM cards and excpandable storage! Huge bright and crisp display. I really like this phone!! 🙌,huawei,1

Absolutely love this phone. Everyone asks where I got it.,huawei,1
"Seller assured me in writing it was fully T-Mobile compatible. I even paid extra for that. Even had a T-Mobile sticker placed over ATT sticker
1st problem - Booted up with ATT Logo.
2nd problem - I had to delete or shut off as much ATT CRAP that I could find.
3rd Problem - Does not support WiFi Calling, at all!
Called T-Mobile and spoke an engineer. Phone can't be made compatible. Hardware chipset for WiFi Calling is designed specificly for ATT. CAN'T be modified. Don't take my word for it. Try if you want. Just giving honest and technically accurate feedback.

"Using device in EU, phone is GSM unlocked and everything's working! The only thing you'll need is to set up APN to your specific mobile network provider and disable the AT&T bloatware. Flashing the phone with ULM kdz firmware is quite easy (tutorials can be found online) and has an option to keep the existing files. It will remove all the bloatware and make the phone eligible to the upcoming Android Pie update. Recommended!
Update (05.08.19.) - Can now be updatable to Android 9 by flashing firmware version V350ULM20D. [Aware - Existing files/applications will be removed. If necessary, an LG Backup can be made on SD card to later be restored.]",LG,1
"This is a wonderful phone at a great price. I refuse to spend the ridiculous amount of money that Samsung and Apple charges for their phones. This phone is just as good if not better! I have Cricket. Took it out of the box, plugged in my Sim card and it worked perfectly with no issues. Excellent battery life and great camera. There are tons of things you can do to customize it. It is the best phone I have ever owned! It also came in 1 day from Amazon with free Prime shipping!",LG,1
"I looked over a lot of phones looking for a replacement aging nexus 6, pocophone looked good but has questionable carrier compatibility and a lot of other unlocked phones in the >$300-400 range. All the budget phones had some serious down side, missing some key feature or just a low spec components. Then I stumbled on to the LG V35 and specs were on par with much pricier phones, the screen is oled witch I prefer and better than 1080, had expandable memory, cameras very good, battery hold charge for a long time. I was a little worried about LG as had bad experience with nexus 5x in the past, but looking at the reviews those issues were resolved. I also looked at the V40, but not a fan of the notch, and it is more money with similar specs. So my opinion is this is the best phone for the money right now, yes its been released a year ago, but compared to current phones in the price range V35 beats them no question. It is odd that this phone is not more popular, I guess at release $900 price tag scared people and then it faded out of the spotlight.
What I did not like: I am coming from a 6 inch phone the older wider screen, this screen is a little narrower. It is still good size, length wise about the same. When watching youtube vertically feels like a smaller screen. It is a little less bright than my old phone, could be a good thing as nexus was too bright at lowest setting when using at night. Coming off of stock android, I don't like LG and ATT bloatware and skins. The shareware is not a deal breaker, nothing that can't be worked around, but thought I mention it.
So I'm happy with the purchase and with the better components this phone should last me for a while, highly recommend this phone.",LG,1
"Phone is great, but it's an at&t phone. Comes with their bloatware and splash screen. I have their service so that's fine, but beware... I doubt it's unlocked.",LG,1
Wasn't new.,LG,0
I am not a techie. I had my LG optimus ProG for about 4 years and was very happy with it. it took me a long time to finally settle on this phone and I love it. It was very easy to set up and use. I'm still learning all the things this phone can do. I'm happy with the camera and the music player and speakers.,LG,1
"Bought phone to replace a 3 year old Moto G3 which was losing battery capacity and having problems with the speaker. Phone is comparable to high end phones, but, at $299, is much cheaper. I have an ATT service, but I was not able to get the hotspot nor the wifi calling to work. Turns out it was due to my older SIM card not supporting 4G and my IMEI not matching the one on my ATT account. A quick trip to the ATT store and the SIM card was replaced and the IMEI changed in the system and now all works well!
Edit: It's been 2 months and I still like this phone. I purchased a second one for my wife. There are a couple of minor annoyances. The automatic brightness control dims the display a little too much in dark rooms. It's supposed to learn based on my adjustments over time, but, in spite of my adjusting it every time, it still dims it a bit too much. Also, I had set up the phone to unlock when the screen is tapped twice. But it kept waking up and calling 911 when it bounced around in my pocket. So I turned off the double tap wake up feature.",LG,0
Quiet speaker and slow camera,LG,0
"Just received the phone yesterday. It looks like brand new, but the box came not sealed. Everything was okay until i check the camera and try it in the Low-light room, and then there’s this thing showed when i want to take a picture, it looks like a big purple tint in the left of the camera. It only shows when using it near object between 1-4cm and when the Autofocus is working. I have found several issues on XDA and find out this is some kind of IR laser working for Autofocus but mine is worst and it ruin the pictures when it shows in low light conditions. I have checked the Wide lens and found it too but it’s just little and hard to notice. Maybe i got a Defective one, so I want to return this and give it one more try.",LG,0
"I will have a small review below this message and my information for Tracfone/Non-AT&T users below the primary phone review.
This phone at only $300 is a solid device compared to other mid-range phones released in 2019. After 2 weeks of use, I can say that this is an excellent choice for people who want the Snapdragon 845's performance at a somewhat affordable price. LG's OS is another bonus, feeling close to stock android and feeling super fast. Android 9 greatly increases the speed and adds nice extra features, but there sadly is no Dark/Night mode to conserve battery. The cameras are amazing and get even better when you port Google Camera over to it. The build quality is solid, but without a case, it is quite a fingerprint magnet. Sound from Bluetooth and the 3.5mm headphone jack are well above average with loud and clean audio. The screen's 6 inch display at 2880x1440 resolution looks amazing and content from Snapchat, Facebook, and Instagram look great with accurate colors. The biggest downside to the device is that the battery isn't very impressive for the price and if battery is a serious concern for you, I'd get a Samsung A70. The phones 18W fast charge capabilities help quite a bit with average charge time being around 1 hour and 20 minutes from 0% to 100%. Overall, this phone is excellent and provides high end features in an affordable mid-range package.
A message to all Tracfone/Non-AT&T service users:
This is an AT&T branded phone. While it is GSM unlocked, it still runs off of AT&T's network and all phone updates (Android 9 Pie and security updates) all come from AT&T and will not be available until you are on their network. This does not mean you need AT&T to get the updates, but you do need an AT&T compatible Sim Card from your service providers Bring Your Own Phone program to receive them. After setting up the Sim Card in the new phone, you'll need to create an APN to use mobile data (at least I needed to on Tracfone). After the phone is fully functional with call, text and mobile data, you should receive the updates within 2-5 days after activating the phone with your service provider. Again, as long as you buy and activate the phone with an AT&T branded Sim Card, you will receive all available updates for your phone. My phone took 2 days to receive the updates and I have had no problems with Tracfones service.",LG,1
"First of all, I want to clear up some stuff about the carrier of this phone.
The version of the phone that is being sold here is the V35PAWM, the AT&T unlocked version of the phone. From what I understand, it will work with GSM carriers without modification. However, I wanted to use the phone with Google Fi. It is quite easy in this case to flash the phone with the V35OULM kdz found here, no urls allowed in reviews, but it can be found on the LG firmwares website. I used the tutorial on the Flash Stock Roms website.
To be clear, the phone should work with GSM carriers without this process. However three are some advantages of flashing the kdz. No more AT&T bloatware, quicker updates (I have heard that some people using the AT&T software with a different carrier are not getting the android 9 update). For Google Fi specifically, some features of the service are not available without using a completely compatible phone. Flashing the OULM software makes the phone ""completely"" unlocked and compatible.
Now about the device itself.
I bought this to replace a Pixel 1 hat had picked up in preparation for an extended trip to Europe. However, the Pixel 1 was very buggy and rather outdated. The LG V35 has more than effectively replaced that phone. With the updated kdz it actually seems to work better with Fi than the picel did and the breadth of options within the os are overwhelming in a positive way. The screen resolution can be changed along with the way the volume interface works for example. Another nice touch is LG's theme options. I am using a theme called Pix Color. This applies a system wide dark mode and also makes the on screen buttons look like those on the pixel, a design that I prefer to LG's. However, the buttons can be hidden to take advantage of the whole screen retaliate, something that can not be done on the Pixel devices and some other android phones.
Speaking of the screen, it is huge and beautiful. The POLED panel looks quite good. My only complaint about the phone so far is actually that I think it is a bit too big, though I realized that is the current design trend. I much preferred the size of the LG G6 that I used to use.
Great phone overall, no real complaints so far.",LG,1
"I had to give my iPhone 7 to my son, had no desire to spend $1000 or eve $750 for a new flagship phone, saw this one at $299 & thought- ""why not?' The phone was every bit as good as the reviews led me to believe it would be. The screen is amazing, so much bigger, brighter and more dynamic than my old iPhone's was, it's fast, smooth and has an excellent camera. I'm not really a heavy phone user, but I do spend some time every day on Duo to video chat with my kids, read news feeds, check emails, play some light games, call & text quite a bit and the battery always lasts the full day. Unfortunately I'm having to return the phone simply because it's so much bigger than my iPhone was, once I put a case on it it was just too big too carry around in my work environment. If I spent much time watching YouTube videos or playing graphic intensive games, I wouldn't hesitate to keep this phone, the screen and processor are that good. I'll probably just end up playing it safe and getting a refurbished iPhone 7, even though it costs more than this one and has a smaller, less vivid, LCD screen. I would recommend this phone and this seller though without hesitation to anyone in the market for a flagship level phone at a midrange price- especially if they're used to today's phone size ranges being on the big side.",LG,1
"What is this device, bought from MobileExpress !? Bought used, however scratches on the screen where not disclosed up-front! And the fact that it is an AT&T phone was not disclosed either! And there's no Android 9 updates, while my friends did receive it, USB-C to HDMI is not working !? I cannot recommend such device, far less from this seller!",LG,1
"I'm quite happy with this phone, particularly for the money. My most recent previous phones were a Samsung Galaxy 6 S active, then a Galaxy 7 Active. I liked both of those phones, good features and very rugged design, but after the 7 developed lines in the screen twice and Samsung wouldn't repair it the second time, though it's a known issue with that model, I decided to bail on them and try something different.
The V35 has some good points. Fast charging with Qi capability, real headphone jack, and expandable memory were the main selling points for me. It's definitely an ATT phone, which I'm OK with as I'm with ATT and will be in the foreseeable future with my wife's corporate discount. I get 5G connectivity in most of the parts of Chicago I frequent, even (surprisingly) in the downtown subway. The Wi-Fi calling works well, which it didn't with the Samsungs.
The screen is fine, good color and resolution. I rarely watch any video on it, but when I have it's been OK. The speaker is pretty wimpy, I do wish it were louder, if the phone is in another room there's a pretty good chance I won't hear it when I have a call or notification. The Samsungs were definitely louder. Bluetooth audio is good, and works well in my car.
The camera is OK. Though the pixel count is similar to my DSLR it's no contest when you look at the same scene photographed with the two of them. No surprise there, but it shows you pixel count is a bad way to compare digital cameras. Color accuracy is so-so, but I don't care all that much as I won't use it for anything important.
My only real negative is the rear power button / fingerprint reader. I'm adapting, but would definitely prefer a side power button.
Battery life is OK, but not anything special. The fast charge offsets that somewhat, when it gets low you can get back up to 100% with a quickness, even using the Qi charging.
One thing I do really like is the 2 year warranty, if they trust their engineering enough to offer that warranty it makes me believe the phone is pretty well constructed.
So overall for the 300 clams it ran me I'm very satisfied, and can recommend it as a good value for the money.",LG,1
The phone was in fact new and unlocked. Works very well with Straight Talk. Remember to punch out the nano-sized card and place it in the slot at the front of the SIM holder. After you get set up with the carrier you will need to google the APN settings for that carrier and manually enter them into the phone. A high quality phone at a super price.,LG,1
"I've had the phone for about 2 weeks now. In general, I love the phone, so far. It was unlocked and easy to set up on the AT&T service that I have. There are preloaded apps, but I have been able to remove one's I don't want. Although, I have only removed a couple, so I'm not sure if they are all removable..The only thing I'm not fond of is the stationary screen to the left of home. But apparently that is becoming the standard for almost all phones and is something I will get used to. The battery life is good...I thought it might be better. But to be honest I use my phone like a mini computer and play on it a lot. No major concerns or complaints.",LG,1
If you are an AT&T customer this is a great deal. Great specs on the phone for a bargain price. Definitely happy with this purchase.,LG,1
"First off, this is a great device for the price. For the week or so I used it, I was very happy with the performance and battery life. Ultimately, I returned the unit because even though it is unlocked, it still has the AT&T firmware load. You are not able to update firmware on the device unless you have AT&T service or an active AT&T SIM. I should have done more research before I bought this one, as this seems to be a widely known issue. Personally, being stuck on a year old firmware without ability to get later versions or security updates is a big issue.",LG,1
"I accidentally drowned my LG v40 & needed to replace it. After doing some research I found this to be the best deal at $300. This is a High end phone at mid-range price. A $800 plus phone does not have much more to justify the price. I'm satisfied with my purchase.....such a underrated phone.
I'm with AT&T and all works perfect. Happy to have Android pie 9.0. For those on another carrier and unable to update to 9.0......why not buy a cheap AT&T pre paid card and update. Another option would be to borrow a friends AT&T SIM card and update.",LG,1
"Hi all. I was in the market for a new, Unlocked phone. A coworker showed me his V35. Thought it looked great. Since I am an AT&T Prepaid Customer, This phone was Perfect. As it is an AT&T phone. Now people can actually reach me. Pull the phone out of the locker(At work) and see Missed Calls and Text messages received. The Sony kept loosing the connection. The only real issue I have with it is, The Finger Print Reader. Can't read mine. Might not be the phone. When I worked as a DoD Civilian, They had Trouble getting my fingerprint for my ID. Took them several tries. After the 2nd attempt at setting mine up, I gave up on it. And chose a Pin. Even connected it to my 2019 Hyundai Kona.",LG,1
"It works with Freedom Mobile and is roaming on AT&T.

"I received a brand new LG V35 ThinQ phone with charger in a sealed box. It is AT&T branded with their software installed, which was fine for me because I use AT&T for service. I just couldn't bring myself to pay what AT&T wants for the exact same phone in their stores. Put my SIM card in, and after several software updates everything is working great including VOLTE and Wi-fi calling (with a postpaid account). I can't attest to it being unlocked as I have not tried another carrier's SIM card in it. I'm coming from an older Moto X and find the LG interface just as intuitive. Great Android experience at a fantastic price!",LG,1
"Been using it a couple days now no issues. I think LG hit a home run with this one.
( Pros=All good for me ) ( Cons=Nothing at this point. ) If anything changes I will re post. I did not rate finger print reader as I do not use it. My job= IT-Admin and Support 25 years. I'm on phone a lot. First day I used it, I bet screen never went off, set for 10 min to sleep. Had 20% left bout 9 Hours. 1/2 bright, Wi-Fi=on, Data=on, Location=on, BT=on
It charged up in apox 1hr and change. ( it did upgrade to 9 (Pie) and that seems stable to ( so far ).
I use a regular Panasonic BT phone at home so i do not have to carry this one around and using BT and Wifi data and Calling at same time was no problem, smooth and clear. My old phone had issues doing this ( all at once ). Thx LG",LG,1
"I love this phone. It's amazing, and it's such a great value. The battery lasts two days on one charge with normal usage (browsing and chatting throughout the day, no calls, lots of email and Twitter). The screen is gorgeous. The fingerprint reader works like a champ. I have absolutely zero complaints about this phone. It's amazing and I love it.",LG,1
"The headphone jack just stopped working, before the phone was a year old. The socket is now completely loose. Headphone jacks no longer snap in, and the phone will no longer recognize any set of headphones I try to plug in. It now only plays through the phone's speaker.
I chose this phone for its high quality dac, to listen to music at work, and when I travel. Originally, I was pleased with it. It used to produce noticeably more clarity than my laptop or previous phone, when using the same headphones (OPPO PM-3) and music files. I wanted the phone to last and tried to be gentle when plugging and unplugging the headphones, which I would do perhaps 2-3 times a day on workdays.
Originally, the battery would hold its charge for 2-3 days with Bluetooth and wireless enabled, but very few applications running. 9 months later, under the same usage, it will last less than a day.
Given the strongly sealed case, the battery does not appear to be replaceable, at least by myself. Perhaps a repair shop can. But I had hoped to get a longer life then 9 months before the battery began to degrade so noticeably.
Everything else about the phone was between good and very good:
The screen is very good, the primary camera is... okay, not great in the dark, even with flash.
I did like that this phone came with fewer bloat apps to disable and remove than my previous samsung phone, though it still had quite a few.",LG,0
"I literally bought this on the day that apple released the new ios 13 update...and my iPhone 6 wasn't able to download that update...or an future updates. I have had enough of Apple telling me when it's time to purchase a new iPhone, so i researched alternatives. After a lot of collaborating, i landed here. The LG V35 Thinq. I am so happy that i did my homework. Good battery life, amazing camera, great sound, wifi and bluetooth connection (which was really important to me. You are a fool if you pay $1000 for a phone that you can get for $300.
The only downside for me:
I am on 3 network. I'm using this phone in the USA and i prefer using AT&T rather than T-mobile, as i am on 'feel at home'. It doesn't seem to stay on AT&T, no matter if i manually choose it or not. It always switches to T-mobile.
Anyways, that is a minor convenience...i love this phone.
GOODBYE APPLE!!!!",LG,1
"First thing's first, this is NOT a new device. The phone had very minor scuff marks on the back and a little knick at the top of the front display. Also, I received a micro usb cable in the box which is not even the right charger for this phone. No SIM ejector tool was included either. The phone itself was in good working condition and the battery life was fine, but I'm just very disappointed that this was marketed as brand new yet it had minimal signs of use.",LG,0
"The phone is in good physical condition and shows some signs of pre-use

I contacted customer service at Amazon to solve this problem, and after more than an hour of chatting with a customer service representative, I didn't get to anything
And they told me they would tell LG about the problem? !!!! They will contact me and tell them at an appropriate time for me to call me, and it has not happened tell now, more than 12 hours have passed since this time and no one has called me
I tried a factory reset it and hard reset it and clear the cash and the camera app data all the software solution

"Phone is great. Unless your buying the newest flagship from samsung or Apple. this phone does everything as quick and vibrant as their predecessors for a fraction of the cost. Long 3500Mah battery, Latest Android version. Great cameras with 60Fps and slow mo. Fingerprint scanner works like a dream. really you cant go wrong here.So if you need a phone and only wanna spend around 250-300 this is the phone you haven't heard of and should. The new processors which are only 1 step above this dont really give you a measurable performance upgrade and some of the more expensive phones will give you a slightly better peripheral ( cameras/ battery, screen resolution, ram ) but will lack in another area. Maybe more ram, but less battery or better screen rez, but lower quality camera. Really if your not spending 800+ on a new phone then dont even waste your time. this phone will out preform and last many phones above its tier.",LG,1
"I purchase this phone for my wife as a brand new phone. when it got to me there was no manual, or paper. the power cable was dirty. I looked past that issue and got the phone ready for first use. However, not long after I wasn't able to hear her when she calls and she had to be shouting to get clarity. The device was returned for an exchange, the process was seamless and easy to comprehend. The new one came the same way without the paper and/or instruction.
I am currently testing the new device due to a similar issue where I called and she had to shout for me to hear her. We have some time to return, so testing the unit now.

I have had LG phones for a while now. I've Loved LG phones I've bragged about LG phones I had the LG 3 and the LG 6 they both lasted Way Beyond the two-year commitment. The cameras on both of those phones we're awesome. When you took a picture it was the color of the item you were taking a picture of. The colors are so off you don't even want to save the picture. For me a great camera on a phone is very important I take pictures of my craft items to sell now I'm going to have to buy a camera where I didn't have to do that before. Also we have a dead zone down the road that we drive through my daughter has had issues going through that dead zone for years with her Samsung even with Verizon. I never had a problem going through the dead zone when I had the LG 3 or the LG 6 now I drop calls just like everybody else in the family. Also I have issues with the GPS I did a trip in 2017 going through eight states and depended on the GPS system and never had a problem going through mountain towns and areas where I questioned losing service but never did with the LG 6. This phone loses its GPS tracking system on a regular basis staying within 50 miles of my house. I would never chance taking a trip with this phone. I did not buy this off of Amazon this was a free phone given to us for switching to AT&T. When I had the LG G3 and LG G6 we had Verizon awesome carrier love them miss them. So I don't know if it is AT&T coverage or if it's the phone but I need to write a review on it so if these things that I have dealt with are important to someone else they might want to look for another phone.,LG,1
"Got this through AT&T last November. Love the phone. Total Package. Lots of ram and storage, nice design, good screen, good battery life, good performance, good cameras, plenty of ram and storage, water resistence, wireless charging, and so on. Great value especially for the patient ones who wait at least 6 months to get it unlocked. Only complaint is software updates but beyond that you can't go wrong here. Best phone from LG to date.",LG,1
"IT'S OK. WHAT I DON'T LIKE ABOUT IT IS YOU CAN'T PUT IT IN A SERVICE MODE.
JUST SAFE MODE. YOU CAN'T CHECK THE PARTS ON YOUR PHONE IF YOU CAN'T PUT IT IN SERVICE MODE.
IF ANYONE KNOWS HOW PLEASE POST IT.
I WOULDN'T HAVE BOUGHT THIS IF I'D KNOWN THAT IT WOULDN'T GO INTO SERVICE MODE.",LG,0

"This phone was supposed to be unlocked, but it wasn’t. Now I trying to figure out how to get it unlocked. It was a gift and it’s been worthless to this point.",LG,0
Phone has trouble keeping reception. Frequent dropped calls.,LG,0
"First off, like many have noted the phone I received is an ATT device. Since I am an ATT customer, it worked without issue and I can't say for sure if the phone is unlocked or not. For those wondering if the phone gets Android 9 (pie), yes it does..at least if you are on ATT. The most recent update, July 2019, improved battery life significantly.
What I look for: Camera (Image Quality both bright and low light), processor, screen, headphone jack.
Camera:
I've been shooting images for nearly 30years and seldom leave home without my DSLR..but when I do I'd like my phone camera to be able to capture decent amounts of detail in various lighting conditions. I wouldn't say this is the best camera, but it surely holds its own. The lowlight mode is a bit slow, but it's working it's magic combining pixels. I've attached a few photos. All in all I'd say it's performance slots in to the upper mid-range/lower high-end.
Processor/Memory: Qualcomm SnapDragon 845 (previous years high-end) + 6GB RAM. This combo keeps the phone moving right along even with Android 9...photo apps and games alike are snappy.
Screen: QuadHD (4k) OLED screen. Really can't get much better than this, no notch, true deep blacks...color reproduction is fantastic...but it is dim. I crank the screen up to 80%+ under direct sunlight and it's still tough to see.
Headphone Jack: It matters to me because I enjoy Audio as much as I do photography. So naturally I love to be able to enjoy my wired AKG headphones. And with a dedicated DAC built into the phone, I can definitely say it's sound reproduction is by far superior to phones in this price range and higher if using the headphone jack. The bad though is that the overall volume it outputs is on the low side. In a noisy room I need the volume to be at a minimum of 50% to hear the music and even higher to be immersive. Volume through Bluetooth is fine.
All in all I'm a happy camper with this phone. I've been a iPhone user since the 6s+, 7+, XR..chasing the camera...and now back to android with this LG V35 thinQ. If performance, value, and features is what you're after..this is the one.",LG,1
"As my old LGK10 was dying, I desperately needed a new phone at a reasonable price. While I was willing to buy a new, alternate brand of phone outright, my carrier would not yield on their push for a monthly financing plan. If any of these irritants sound familiar, or you just want a great phone, this could be a good choice for you.
I received a new, unlocked LG35 thinQ phone.. It arrived in an unsealed box with an ATT logo like the merchandise you buy from the carrier. The product contained the phone , a plug and power cord, an instruction book, lens wipe and SIM slot pin. You do NOT get a SIM card, ear buds or a glass protector.
This phone has triple the storage of the K10 (64 ) vivid color and pixel display and an optional AI photo system for the camera. The normal Google installs, basic ATT apps and LG apps (new since my orig LG 10 purchase) ARE also included on the device. I don't think it had too much bloatware. Phone audio is excellent and I noticed it is hitting both 5G and 4G networks.
The phone is ""Qi"" enabled so the wireless charging could help avoid the bent prung problems that accelerate damage when using wall chargers. I had no problems setting up my fingerprint reader, but this model can also be programmed for facial recognition, voice print, traditional passwords, or knock patterns.
ATT was very helpful in transferring data and contact lists etc to the new device. My old SIM and micro SD fit into the same slot.
The best point by far was the price!! This truly is a wonderful deal on a wonderful product ! Upon placing my Amazon order, I even received a link from the distributor to further product support. LG fans should not pass this up.",LG,1
"I bought this device to activate on Straight Talk GSM, and as advertised, this product is unlocked. AT&T's bloatware is relatively unintrusive, and after cleanup it doesn't take up much of the device's internal storage.
With that said, it's an excellent phone with few compromises.
Overall, the LG V35's build quality is excellent. Beautiful glass exterior with a stylish design reminiscent of a Galaxy S9+. It feels great in the hand, even with a bulky impact case on. The 1440p OLED screen is fantastic as well. It's nearly as good as a Samsung panel.
Performance-wise, this device is quite snappy. The Snapdragon 845 and 6GB of RAM make multitasking a breeze, and there is no lag in LG's stock ROM at all, even with all the apps I have installed. The LTE modem delivers outstanding performance, as does the Wi-Fi modem. I've never been able to get 70mbps download over LTE in my back yard, but now I can.
The camera is great as well. The rear cameras take great still shots, and the front camera is more than adequate for Snapchat. Video is also quite good. The images are very vivid and crisp.
Battery life is acceptable, and it isn't really a problem if you have the included Fast Charge brick on hand.
Audio is also pretty good. It comes with a high-quality DAC for 3.5mm headphone audio playback, which sounds excellent. The mono speaker is decent for voice calls and talk shows, but is pretty shrill for music.
It does come with AT&T-specific features like Visual Voicemail, voice over LTE, and WiFi calling, but I have yet to get them working on Straight Talk.
My only concern is software updates. The included software is pretty good, but the security patches only reach November 2018, and LG is notorious for being slow with software updates. If you absolutely need up to date security patches, beware.
I would normally expect a phone like this to cost $700, and even then it's a reasonable price, especially if you're an AT&T customer. However, it's only $350, and it is an excellent deal. Would recommend.",LG,1
I have cricket service and it works perfectly,LG,1
"I wanted to upgrade my LG V20 on tmobile's network, but didn't want to pay 800+ or lock myself into a 2year contract so I was looking at cheap phones. I came close to buying a renewed/used Essential or similar for 150, but then came across the ATT unlocked V35 thinq. I was very worried about using an ATT phone on tmobile, but figured I'd try it.
I'm so glad I pulled the trigger. After receiving the phone I realized I may not be able to get updates as I'm not on ATT's network.. I then noticed this phone was an official google-fi phone, which should mean its 100% compatible with tmobile, and should also allow me to get updates.
It was easy to use the LG software to update the phone to the latest firmware for Google-Fi (listed as GFI on LG's website), leaving me with a debloated OS that will allow me to obtain future updates. As far as using the GoogleFi on Tmobile's network, it works perfect. The phone's hardware has the same bands as the V20 so I wasn't expecting to get the 600mhz band. I'm getting at least as good reception as my V20 and speed tests are perfectly fine (140mb in some cases).
I've been hyping this to everyone I know who might want a new phone and may be on tmobile, att, or google-fi. Yes it's not a 2019 phone with the latest bands but its easily better then many phones and was very much over-looked in 2018.",LG,1
"I ordered this phone as a new unlocked gsm phone. I recieved an email from the seller before the phone arrived about contacting them for an unlock code if needed when trying to activate on my network. I've bought unlocked phones for years and never had to input any code to make it work. They assured me that the phone was new though. I got the phone, inserted my sim card and powered up to an AT&T logo along with the standard AT&T bloatware, I'm on Cricket so its the same network and the data and calling worked. After a little while playing with the phone i noticed that on a bright white background the center third of the screen looked dingy/yellow, brown. I did some research and found no related issues to this particular phone but some problems with other OLED screens having ugly whites. I changed the screen tones and it was a little better. Several hours later after playing an online game with my son I set the phone down on the table and it sounded like a thin piece of plastic, I looked and found the the back upper left corner of the glass was pulled away from the frame of the phone with a very noticeable gap, I could see glue residue where it should be sealed at. That was the final straw, I immediately started the return on Amazon, swapped my sim card back to my old phone, boxed it up and sent it back the next day.
The phone was very smooth. It took good pictures and played games at the highest resolution and frame rate. This particular phone did not come close to the quality I expected after reading so many great reviews.
A couple of days later I found this same phone through Cricket for 299. I went to the store and put my hands on the last one instock. The screen was excellent with clean bright white and no signs of the back coming loose from the frame. I bought the phone and have enjoyed it since. I also found that the phone Cricket is selling is truely unlocked, it doesn't even have Cricket logo on starting and the only bloatwear is from LG. I recommend this phone but be careful where you buy it from.",LG,0
I seriously love this phone. I had a samsung Galaxy s 5 and it fi ally bit the dust... I wanted an android and my dad reccomended an LG.. The reviews on this I e were good...i spent more than i had origionally planned but everyone said great phone for $350 Which when I dont have to make payments on a phone is actually a good price...they werent wrong! I'm not used to the speed or the capacity of what it can do! I have been using the battery a lot just caise i cant put it down. The only thibg i dont love is I couldnt immediatly figure out how to turn off the data. And use my Wi-Fi instead..but once I figured that out (the next day) I havent had issues. Also it takes a nano SIM card so i litterally went to AT&T with old and new phone and they took care of SIM card and phone transfer all done in 10 min. Was happy! I'm just sad i waoted so long to make the switch!!,LG,1
Why do I like this phone? After 48 hours - here is my impression. This thing is FAST. Every app loads virtually instantly - connects very quickly. Its built for AT&T network and connects better to their network than any phone I have tried. What really sets this apart too is the sound quality. The EQ processing for car audio is awesome! Lots of control over the surround channels - bass etc. With headphones its even better! ---- it feels like a premium phone in the hand --- symmetrical and elegant. And NO NOTCH! This phone seems more supported by LG than others - several patches - up to and through Android 9 Pie. Camera quality is above average. It beats my friends Samsung S7 edge quite nicely - which beat by previous LG G5. $299 was pricing - cant get a better deal IMO.,LG,1
"I have contacted my carrier Safelink Wireless (it's programmed with an AT&T phone number though) numerous times and have received and installed 2 new sim cards and still cannot get WiFi Calling to enable! I was told by both Safelink and AT&T that these phones are locked to AT&T and the only way to get WiFi calling to work is you have to get your service directly from AT&T so they can lock your phone number into their service and not any other carrier like Safelink, Net10 or T-Mobile. It will not work even though I have an AT&T phone number... When I called up AT&T and even went in to an AT&T store they told me that they can't locate my account because I'm not directly with them and that my service account is with Safelink, THIS STINKS!!! I either have to stay with Safelink and forgo WiFi calling or cancel my service and setup new service directly with AT&T at a higher monthly fee just to enable WiFi calling... Other than that the phone itself is great, it's quick, fingerprint sensor works great, facial recognition also works very quick. I was even able to upgrade to Oreo 9.0 The only other downside to this phone is the battery life, my old phone was a BLU Vivo 8 and the battery in that phone would last up to 2 days, with the V35 using the same apps in the same manner as the old Vivo 8 this V35 lasts if I'm lucky maybe 1 day. Screen display is great, camera takes wonderful pictures and videos, sound is so so with only one speaker. It's much faster and the screen is much better than my Vivo 8 with no notch at the top of the screen. I even installed a 256mb microSD card into the available slot to store picts,videos and most apps to free up processing speed. For the price it's a great phone.",LG,0
"A great phone at an excellent price with excellent features such as light weight, dimensions, OLED display, RAM and the battery.
I bought this phone to use it outside the USA, the GSM is unlocked and everything works fine, I just had to configure the APN for my local network as discussed in other reviews. Originally the operating system came with version 8, I tried to update it to version 9 by myself but I used a ULM kdz firmware and it was not compatible with the phone version since this was a V35AWM10w, so I had to contact a specialist who was able to flashing the firmware to V350AWM20d and update the phone to android 9 Pie.",LG,1
"I am very satisfied with this purchase. I have always used an iPhone and finally made the decision to switch to an android. I am not disappointed! This phone is awesome. It is fast and takes really great pictures. Sometimes when using certain apps I have to press slightly more on the screen in order for it to pick up. This seems to happen with Facebook mostly so could just be the app. Portrait mode on the camera is amazing. Crystal clear images that almost look professional. The phone doesn't have a lot of memory but you are able to import a micro SD if needed. The sound quality on this phone is great, too; I don't really need a speaker anymore. It's also WATERPROOF which is a huge plus when having children. For $400 (which is HALF the price of a Galaxy) you get a great deal and value out of this phone! Remember though that this phone will only work with carriers like Cricket and AT&T, not Verizon or Sprint. I recommend this phone 100%!!",LG,1
"I moved to this phone from a galaxy s8, it is a great value for the cost. My galaxy s8 was working fine but the screen had cracked badly and was entirely too much money to fix. I was looking for something decent for less than the cost of repair so I stumbled upon this gem of a phone on amazon. First, I like the screen size ratio. It is wider than the galaxy and I like the display better like that. It also feels nice in my hand. Second, The repair costs are super reasonable. I had this phone 2 weeks and cracked the screen. Repair cost was $146 and was completed quickly and it looked and felt like a new phone when I got it back. This phone also has a 2 year warranty vs the others 1 year. This phone does tasks fast and has a great camera.",LG,1
"As other reviews have stated, this is not an unlocked phone. This is an AT&T Phone. There are no instructions on how to get the phone unlocked. The phone I received appeared new. For the price, I won't complain too much. The phone itself is nice and has nicer features than the phone I was looking to get at about the same price (Moto G7). I purchased this phone after having a G5 Plus. I, as many other people I'm sure, refuse to purchase a phone for $600+. The $350 I paid is ok.",LG,1
"No sim card with phone? Packaging says there is a SIM card. When I try to get Technical support I get the run around with the program to have them return my phone call. Very frustrating, can't make a complete review without sim card",LG,0
This phone is replacing the Lg v20 that I loved for years. A little smaller but a powerhouse of a phone. Had it for a few days and loving it. I'm using it on Cricket Wireless ans no problems what so ever !,LG,1
"I was on the market for an S9+, but saw this phone for almost half the price but with the same specs. It was a no brainer of a purchase, and after having it for a week, im glad i found this steal. The screen is great, the phone is snappy and responsive, I havent messed around with the camera too much but based on professional reviews it's solid. The fingerprint reader is snappy, my phone battery easily lasts a day on above average usage. The device is waterproof, the design is pleasing and feels good to hold in the hand, feels solid. After a week of usage i have had no real complaints regarding this device. If you're on the market for a 2019 android flagship phone, you cant pass on this deal, not at this price.
For those worried about the unlocked nature of the phone, yes it is an unlocked At&t phone, but trust me, that doesnt matter. Just disable the At&t apps and boom, you'll be fine. I cant speak for its functionality on other US carriers, but I am from Jamaica, and it works perfectly on our Digicel Network.",LG,1
"I haven't had my phone that long, but I haven't found anything I don't like about it. I don't use the fingerprint reader, but that is personal preference. The camera takes very good quality pictures and the screen resolution is super! I've only had this phone for 1 week, but I would highly recommend it.",LG,1
"beautiful phone to bring to metro. easy to switch over from att ""possession"" - long as you input your previous metro phone's info: name, apn, mmsc, mcc, mnc, apn type (do not enter anything here), apn protocol, apn naming protocol into your network settings - so you can connect data to metro provided internet. also, you'll need to disable, uninstall a few att bits imcluded in this ""unlocked,"" but not lg stock item. much simpler than it sounds. call metropcs - they'll get you started. whole set-up took me about 3 hours - much of it updating and downloading apps. figuring out what worked was relatively easy. i now have a wonderful ""new"" better phone at the $300 price point. yea for me!",LG,1
I'm afraid I have to give a 3 star for false advertising because it says it comes unlocked but the phone is still locked.,LG,0
"phone works great, and despite the AT&T branding at startup it operates on my MVNO just fine. for the price you just can't beat all the features this phone has though. For a $300 phone this will blow the competition away in any side-by-side comparison.
sidenote, because the phone is unlocked it will NOT receive the android 9/pie update.",LG,1
"Moved from LG V10 to V35, V10 is still working good but I needed an upgrade. Once you use LG product and if you are loyal then its hard to look for other options.
I received my package early, securely and inside Amazon's box I found this Brand New, Uncut Seal, New devise; made me happy.
The reason I went with V35 because I hate those NOTCHES. I am waiting for LG to go full screen 90% screen to body ratio.
But that time, I am happy with the OLED screen clarity, sound quality via DAC. and this is definitely an improvement for me over V10.
I am good for another 3 years for sure.",LG,1
"This phone as just about all the flagship specs you could want. The camera is very good and comparable to the Galaxay S9. The screen is fantastic OLED display. In all reality most people just surf the web and text so you don't need the latest processor for that. In addition, the camera bump from year to year doesn't justify for me spending $700-1k for an entirely new phone that's picture quality well better is not leagues better. So this phone should be all you need for the next 1.5 -2 years easy. In addition, I'm able to use the hotspot and Wifi calling that others are saying they can't do. I'm using it on T-mobile. I simply took it to T-mobile and told them to set the APN setting up. Once that was done I test out both features and use the hotspot daily.",LG,1
"The phone has all the features I wanted. Lot's of ATT 'extras' on the phone. I got rid of what I could. I have cricket wireless as my service provider and the phone works great. As of now, the only thing I do not like is the battery life. I have done everything possible to extend the life. Yesterday it was barely used, and by the afternoon it was at 50% and that was with the option to be in the extended battery life mode. I am going to continue to investigate what else I can do regarding this problem.",LG,1
I especially like the dark room / evening outdoor photo enhancer. You turn it on and those dark photo's come in so much clearer. It's pretty cool! Haven't discovered all the cool options yet but am very happy with my phone!!,LG,1
"Phone, package, on it self was perfect.
Unfortunately I was unable to make my metro PCS sim card running.
I tried to switch networks, reset all network settings, add APN.
Sim card didn’t work.
Contact with seller was very good, and we manage to resolve this issue.",LG,1
I bought this because it was unbranded and would work with LTE AT&T 4G. This phone has been great! I heard the battery was not good but it lasts longer than my Samsung phone ...... I really think it is worth the money for a mid range phone. I would buy it again.,LG,1
"Description led me to believe this is a FACTORY UNLOCKED phone since AT&T isn't listed anywhere on the page. However, it is AT&T unlocked. 2 stars because it does work with Google Fi...with the exception of all the Fi network extras the I expected to work with a factory unlocked version of the phone. Really considering sending it back though and getting a real Fi compatible phone.",LG,0
"$350 for hardware that rivals flagship devices, it's such a steal. Set up was very easy. I have cricket so all I had to do was put in my SIM card and I was ready to go. Comes with warranty from LG and instructions on how to set up for other GSM networks like T-Mobile.",LG,1
"Consumer Report Rated the LG V35 ThinQ as one of their best.

"I wouldn't recommend this phone to anyone. I returned one for constant bugs and crashing and somehow received a second one which performed worse.

Best phone,LG,1
"Everything's great about this phone, especially the battery life. The camera is amazing. This is a close-up of denim fabric on a pair of Wrangler blue jeans.
The AT&T/Android software has two bugs which annoy me, and I hope get fixed in a later revision.
1. Occasionally, the Email app will display all messages as a blank white screen. You have to open the App Manager, force stop the Email app, and then restart it.
2. The OS will randomly disable Looping Home Screen. You have to open Settings > Display > Home Screen to re-enable it.",LG,1
"If u want to listen to music with ""headphones,"" do NOT buy this phone. Bought thru Google Fi. After a few minutes, phone will silence, not turn down, silence the music. Even if I have it less than half on media sound, still happens.
UPDATE: Through research, I found there are several issues that can cause the sound issue. I was able to connect mine back to a step tracker app that I had downloaded. Ridiculous since a lot of people listen to music while walking/running. Still a problem LG needs to fix all around.",LG,0
"Ok, I am coming from an Honor 6X and a S7. This phone packs a 6 inch screen in the same size as my Honor 6x 5.5. I even used the Honor case for 2 days while waiting on my new case. This thing is POWERFUL . I can play my games WIDE OPEN. and CALLS are crystal clear. I can pick up calls in my basement that other phones have issues with. I got the ATT version and am using it on TMOBILE. I dont mind the ATT stuff on the phone. BUT OMG, I hate the FB app . gonna have to remove it with ADB.
I recommend this phone. I like it cause it is wider than the G7. and has 6 gigs or Ram instead of 4. My laptop only has 4 geesh.
It doesnt come wiht a Wireless charger so BUY ONE. I LOVE WIRELESS CHARGING NOW!!!!.
Pictures are very good. but I can only compare it to my old phone. They are better than the Honor or the S7.
Ok the weak spot. Just one speaker and its not all that loud. For me No problem.
Would I but again. YES. But ask me again after a year of use.
2 week Update... TO THE DOLTS ... ON TMOBILE
I am on TMobile... THIS is an ATT BRANDED PHONE DUH! Look up the model number...
IT Is UNLOCKED. I had to contact the vendor for the Key. THIS WAS A 1000 Dollar phone for 300 dollars ..You should shut up and be happy ATT bought to many so they are being unloaded CHEAP. I used wifi calling with out issue. If it doesnt work for you maybe its your SIM.
I love my new phone. Its super fast, calls sound great, its water proof , it has survived its first fall.
CON...Its an ATT Branded phone. LG is slow on updates. NO PIE, YET... Ypu will have to get an ATT prepaid SIM to upgrade to PIE. OH BOY 10 BUCKS...If ypu cant afford it go get an Obama Phone.",LG,1
"I actually read privacy policies, and this is the scariest one I have ever seen. Not only does LG reserve the right to take all your information (location, contacts, pictures, videos, email, etc) for their thinQ AI and for Google Assistant, they also reserve the right to force Over-the-air updates which remove features from the phone and cannot be rolled back. You're paying $730 for LG to potentially spy on you, sell your personal data to everyone else, brick your phone and make you pay more to get it working again.
Pretty much no phone has privacy anymore, but this is the most eggregious violation of decency I've seen yet. It is pretty though... I wish I could have made it past the ""agree to this privacy policy"" screen to see what else it could have done.",LG,0
"Phone was LOCKED to Claro network, could not use on my current network (Verizon)",LG,0
"First of all, my last 2 phones were both iPhones and I chose Android this time because of the compatiblity with other devices. Why LG G7? Every flagship has the same specs, but the sound on this one... perfection!
Pros:
- Sound with and without headphones is great, I don't think if anyone could improve this.
- O.S. dont freezes, actually is the best LG (I repair phones, so I tested every LG that exists, except for the V30).
- AI Cam is great, but it can improve like everything new.
Cons:
- Facial Recognition is a little bit slower.
Great phone!
9.5/10",LG,1
It's not a factory unlocked phone. It's a Claro Wireless phone that someone unlocked. Software and updates come from Claro.,LG,0
"- LG must be falling short in their Marketing department because this phone flew under the radar..
- This is a Great Product.. there is nothing legitimately negative you can say about this phone
- Hot take,... this phone looks better in hand than the new ",LG,1
This phone is from Argentina so it may not work as expected.,LG,0
"Its a cheap product with cheap camera. Even phones costing 100$ will give same quality pics. Both front and back are worst. 0/5
Sound is not to the expectation Bass however is good but don't expect much. 1/5
Display i would give negative rating. Dont expect seeing the Q HD or other things. Its so dull 0/5
After an update display is stunning awesome. 5/5
Charging is in reverse way lol. It went down from 50% to 15% in 15 minutes. But from 15% to 0% in 45minutes. Something goes wrong here 0/5
After the update 4/5
Dont know why lg is feeling high in pricing the phones more than 600$ including taxes. I would tag 150$ worth for lg g7 thinq. (Negative rating -5/5)
After the update I would tag 450$
Phone was also Super heat sometimes
No overheating after the update
Out of the box is display (Super bright ) and camera is the best for low light pics.
Sound or gesture vibration patterns are so good",LG,1
"I have been using the G5 and G6 is because of the wide angle selfie. Now the G7 has quietly removed that feature. If i had known that, i wouldn't order the product.
Now i'm returning it and might get the upcoming V40 instead. LG should have been more clear about this on their website and product promotion.",LG,0
"Really love the size and build of this device. The audio was great, the screen was great. Performance really suffered in that the OS did not seem optimized for the hardware (stutters and lags) but this was most evident in the camera software which would lock up during launch or during a photo capture, sometimes not even taking a photo. This was also reflecting in the poor battery life, very moderate use in good signal area resulted in 50% drain with only a few hours (mostly in standby). Wanted to really like this device but it didn't work out.",LG,1
I bought this phone to replace my broken LG G5. All apps work fine except those for Basic and Premium Visual Voicemail. I spent 2+ hours on phone with Verizon to try to resolve the problem. No luck because this phone is not configured to allow those apps to work. I am back to dialing *86 to access voice messages. Pain in the neck!,LG,0
"Having issues connecting to at&t 4GLTE. I was finally able to get connected to AT&T 3G network after being at the AT&T store and on the phone for 2 hours. This phone is from the Latin American network provider Claro and the box instructions (all in Spanish) said LG Panama. This is my 3rd LG G series phone. I like the fit, simplicity, and performance but I dont think I will buy another phone from amazon.",LG,0
"Other than defects, which can happen in any brand and model, once we ordered a replacement this product seems to operate fine. Note that the G7 ThinQ does not have an identical user interface to the LG V35. G7 is much less intuitive to use or find desired settings and appears to be missing some useful settings or options found on the V35 model. Quality of materials is excellent and sound quality is above average, though not as good as as the Moto Droid Turbo 2 it replaced (the T2 had dual sizable front-facing stereo speakers). Given the choice again, now that we know the user interface difference, we would choose the V-series rather than G-series phone.",LG,1
"This was advertised as compatible with all US carriers, but the phone I received did not have an antenna that could connect to Verizon's network.",LG,0
"Hugely disappointed with phone IMEI not in Sprint database and I have even contacted LG. Wastedlot of hours with calls/chats made to Am a zon, LG Customer support, but eventuy have to return the device.",LG,0
What a phone by used gadget. This guys are awesome. Initially i ordered this phone which got lost during shipping but used gadget helped me out get me the refund. Then I ordered again the another phone this guys “used gadget”. The phone is in my hand now and I can’t believe that I only paid 200 usd for this amazing phone. It’s not even old. I guess it’s a new phone. I am so thankful to used gadget.,LG,1
Love this phone its way better than iPhone x,LG,1
Been a samsung owner for years but love my G7. Had a few months and its still problem free!,LG,1
"Well I honestly am glad I got this phone it's fast I've seen no lag in anything I do I watch alot of movies just wish I could make the videos play a little larger than it allows me to do but great video quality... Picks up service better than my LG Stylo 4 that was branded for metro by T-Mobile shows a lower connection but is not giving as much buffering in my videos even at 1080p quality
Would suggest making sure you have either a charger or a battery pack with you the battery isn't as strong as it could be but lasts well enough to get by on most days",LG,1
"I had issues with delivery. The sellers didn't even care but usps was quite helpful
I like the camera.. Super bright...picks out every pimple and the battery life? Awesome",LG,1
"This is a steal right now at the price it is (grey). $430 for the outgoing flagship level phone. I got a factory sealed new LM-G710ULM from Amazon, not a third party. Unlocked G7 GSM. I bought a nano SIM since my old phone had a micro and I didn't want to cut it down. Straight Talk wireless. Service transferred right over in a couple of minutes. I had a G3 and the backup & restore worked like a champ. Toss in the 2nd year of warranty from LG and what's not to like?",LG,1
"Ordered this because it was recommended for the sound clarity, and I am hard of hearing. Worked great! Awesome phone- however, I live at the end of the ATT signal area -and though my old MotoG often got only one bar, I could always call out and receive calls. But there are times when I have no bars with this phone and have no service indoors... so I am reluctantly sending it back.",LG,1
Love this phone. Worked perfectly out of the box with my straight talk SIM that uses Verizon's towers. Enabled Google's phone app and visual voice mail works without a hitch. Wish they would hurry up and push the android 9 update they promised. Make sure you buy the one sold and shipped by Amazon instead of the 3rd party sellers if your worried you won't get the correct model like others have claimed. Amazon for sure ships you the carrier unlocked model listed here. And not the sprint variant some people are getting.,LG,1
Was my first Android phone so I don't have much to compare it to. But I just didn't like it right off the bat. I traded it in for a Galaxy s9+ and I LOVE it!,LG,1
The phone stopped working.for a minute or 2 when open or freezes.it was nothing as advertised.so I decided 2 send it back.and wait on something else.,LG,0
"This phone is locked to Claro which is in South America. It is Sep 2019 and still do not have the Pie Update!!! So disappointed for a $450 phone. Its a shame because the hardware is great, LG simply does not care about existing customers and only focus on new products G8 etc. Guess what LG, anyone who buys your phone will never get another one! You will eventually run out of suckers.",LG,0
"The ad says specifically:
""The LG G7 Thin Q phone is compatible with AT&T, Sprint, T-Mobile & verizon networks ""
This is a straight LIE.
It is not compatible with ANY of the networks listed above, except att-the most expensive - go figure right?
Every single one of those companies says it is not compatible with their networks..",LG,1
"If you buy one of these it is almost certainly going to be for one carrier or another. It will still work on Google Fi, but you don't get all of the features.",LG,0
NOT VERIZON COMPATIBLE,LG,0
"I use this for everyday use and it's a great product for the normal user. The battery will get you through the day, the camera is top notch, the screen is nice and bright, and the opperating system/UI is great as well.",LG,1
"I like the phone. LG is very user-friendly. Only thing I don't like is that it has ""Claro"" on it. Think it was made for spanish-speaking countries.",LG,1
I would in a conversation and they cannot hear me....i can hear them .it just shut off all the time.its not good for me,LG,0

"Did tons of research on what phone to get and after several weeks, decided to go with the G7 because I like the LG format. I double- and triple-checked every phone I looked at to make sure that they were compatible with Verizon as I know ordering any unlocked phone online can be very finicky because of this. The manufacturer and seller both specifically stated in the Q&A section that the phone is compatible with Verizon, so it seems to me that they either don't know their own product or that they just flat-out lied. Such a bummer because I was so excited to set up this phone when I got it. Hopefully this review will be more helpful than the false information I received. Will not be ordering from this seller again.",LG,0
"This is the first phone i can honestly say I hate! I have had nothing but problems with it.
1. I cracked the screen a few weeks into ownin it( never cracked my iphone). I have insurance on the phone, but a year later i still have a cracked screen because no one carries the screens and the only way to fix it is to mail it off for a month.
2. Its was suppose to have the best possible camara according to the LG guy at sprint that day. Too bad my friend showed me their Samsung 9 with a better camara a month later
3. It wont connect to my car through the blue tooth or usb port. There is a lg app that is supposed to fix this issue,. But that doesn't work eithet.
4.
It often takes multiple tries to connect to wifi or blue tooth devices. Ones that our iphone connects to with no issues!
5.
In recent months it has began freezing on a regular basis. It will generally kick out in 10 to 30 minutes. But i just had to take it to the sprint store after it froze gor 5+ hours and nothing would work. Not the power button to trying to get it to reset.
6. Sometime it gets so hot i cant touch the screen. This has happened with several different apps that i WORK with on a daily basis and a few gaming apps. I should have to quit a project or have a extra fan just to keep a phone cool!!!!
Overall a terrible phone i wish i had never bought. AND IM STILL PAYING IT!!!
STAY AWAY! DONT BUY, YOU WILL REGRET IT!!!!!",LG,0
Returned phone with in few days! Camera locks up when taking pictures. Have completely go out of camera mode then return. By then subject is missed. Freezes when typing. People cant hear me alot or me hear. Have to turn phone practically up your nose and cover face. Things seem to just dissappear like icons and pictures go to different places. Touch screen is good. Alot probs and impatient to use and figure out. Went back to store several times. They already to redo and reset things. They asked if i wanted to new 1. No! Now getting the g6 wich i should have gotten!!! Now i have to pay restock fee and tax again!!! Hate this phone. Had my daughter try it. She hates it to. She has the 6. For the price....no!!! Features not much different but dont work as should or when they want. No again to suggest this phone!! Company just pushed purchase because it was more $. My opinion. If this works out for others good for you. I must have gotten the bad 1.,LG,0
LTE doesn't supported band 3 used in Europe Why? This doesn't suppose to be cheap smartphone,LG,0
"Even as the Frequencies do match up, the phone is still labeled as incompatible even as the phone is said to be compatible with Verizon right at the top. The reason is the model I received which is LGG710AWM. This is really different than the model on the website itself.",LG,0
"DO NOT BUY THIS PHONE!!!! Right out of the box it has issues with the camera and gallery syncing together. Enjoy taking photos and sending them to people? Well then this isn't the phone for you. Enjoy being able to screenshot your screen? Well then this isn't the phone for you. Because these features DO NOT WORK. LG's solution is to force you to mail in your phone, wait 2-4 weeks for them to look at it and ""repair it"". Only to get back your same piece of crap glitchy phone. DO NOT BUY. The only perk of the phone is the ability to dual screen.",LG,0
this phone was really outstanding to me and i really did enjoy all the features of the phone.LG did a great job on the design of this phone and would really love to do another review on one of these great phone on my you tube channel and show the people the meaning behind this great product .I recommend you buy the phone and try it out for yourself.,LG,1
"Before I start my review, I would like to mention that my previous phones were the Iphone 5, Samsung Galaxy S7, and a Samsung Galaxy S9. I will use the Galaxy S9 for a couple of examples since it’s the last phone I had (and my wife still has hers). Alright, hold on tight for this one because I got inspired lol…
PROS:
SCREEN - The first thing that with catch your attention is the screen. This screen is colorful, sharp, bright, and very attractive to the eye. It has a feature I’ve never seen on any other phone where it can boost the screen brightness at a very high level so its easy to use when on direct sunlight. Also, its flat which means no weird edge screen like the Galaxy S9 (this means no screen glare on the corners and tempered glass screen protectors are compatible).
CAMERA – The camera is very impressive with nice color enhancements. The COOLEST feature is the wide-angle lens. Its not a fisheye like the gopro, but it lets you take incredible photos from a very close distance.
BATTERY – yeah, I have no idea why people complain about the battery of this phone. Maybe is because they pay too much attention to the hardware. The truth is the phone lasts the entire day with absolutely no problem. I feel the battery performance is as good (if not better) than the Galaxy S9.
FACE RECOGNITION – The face recognition is fast…very fast. You don’t have to find the perfect angle or wait for it to unlock. I find it to unlock in 1 second or less.
SOUND – The sound its loud, clear, but when placed on a table it has no competition. It really beats the phones out there.
CONS:
CAMERA – Although the camera in general way better than the Samsung Galaxy S9, night photography (front camera) with the S9 turns out to be slightly better. This is because the S9 has double aperture.
SIDE BUTTON – This phone includes an extra button that activates google now. I do not use google now so it would be nice to be able to use this button as another shortcut such as camera, email, or any other thing.",LG,1
"The phone in and of it self is a good phone, however, it's not the US version (G710ULM) with a US warranty as advertised (3/8/19); it's the international version (G710EM) with no available US warranty.
One way to tell if you've been ripped off is to check the model number in ""Settings/About Phone"". If you have any other number other than G710ULM, you don't have the US version with a warranty. If a time comes when you need warranty service, you are sorry out of luck.
I contacted LG directly, provided LG with the IMEI number for the phone, and they confirmed the phone was intended only for in the UK, not for in the USA. LG also confirmed you cannot get a US warranty for it.
Another way to tell if you've been ripped off is to power off the phone and power it back on. If you see ""Claro"", and words in another language, you've been ripped off. ""Claro"" is a carrier in Guatemala, and is what the phone I received booted up with. Additionally, the phone had ""Claro"" bloatware installed on it, of which couldn't be uninstalled.
Additionally, there are compatibility issues with this phone for US carriers because it's an international version, not a US version. I have AT&T, and they've informed me phone calls should work, but there may be very slow data speeds because of network conflicts with the international version. I confirmed this with a data speed tests, and my data speeds were very inconsistant and very slow.",LG,0
"So I bought this at B&H with a big discount. It lists $120 less than this one, but it comes with several freebies that make the phone cost around $530ish . Tx&Sh are included. You get a tempered glass screen protector. And you get a pair of earbuds with mic.
Now the phone. I checked this out at T Mobile and was stunned by the screen. Loved the 19.5:9 ratio. It makes the phone bigger than my old one without making it too big. It still has to fit in my front pocket. Screen is so nice and android 8 is nice. The two things I look for in a phone besides calls, text and email is for photos and music.
Camera is very good. (With latest updates it's better than the iphone 7+) Maybe not the very best, but if you aren’t a YouTube reviewer you won’t be comparing it to 10 other phones. Took some videos and really liked them. Cool feature is you can pause the video, but keep it as one video file, just with breaks. It also has separate camera and video record buttons, just like my digital camera. No fumbling with a menu to switch between photo and video. Low light is good. Wide angle is really nice for indoor shots.
Music is a priority to me. I listen to music thru my car speakers all the time. I also need a headphone jack to do this, so that really limited my choices. I’m so glad LG kept the jack. The Quad DAC is awesome! It does make the music sound better even my car speakers. Boom box is nice, the speaker is very loud, probably the loudest you can get. Bass is absent until you place it on a table. Mids and highs are just fine.
Overall this is perfect for me. No messing with iTunes. I hate iTunes so much I will never buy an iPhone. All I want to do is add music effortlessly. Really just love everything about the phone.
2 month update:
The extended battery option definitely helps with battery life. I’m a light to medium user, so I often go two + days before charging.
Fast charge really is fast. It charges 1% per minute.
Google assistant is actually really cool, when it works. I really didn’t know what this was all about, but am finding that I use it a lot now. It’s just like Alexa, which I use all the time at home. So using this isn’t hard to get use to. The LG G7 has an always on listening mic so you just say ‘hey google’.
Most will complain about the LG skin on top of android. I actually like some of the features. The floating bar is useful and I use it everyday. I use the LG music player because googles music player is just an ad machine. No matter what setting I set, google music will eventually start pushing its paid services and music I have no interest in.
Super bright boost screen is actually useful. In broad daylight while wearing sunglasses, I can keep my sunglasses on and still see my screen. I’ve used boost more often than I thought I ever would.
So many unlock methods it’s ridiculous. I use in this order, face unlock, fingerprint unlock, knock code, voice unlock. I am finding that I wish the fingerprint unlock was in the screen instead of behind.
As a phone the size is really nice. Thin, kind of heavy and long. It reminds me of holding a home phone. When holding it up to my ear, the mic extends all the way to my mouth, it feels natural and not like a small toy the way most phones feel.
After several updates the camera is amazing! Some of the best photos I’ve seen. With latest updates photos are now better than the iPhone 7+. I now use my phone for all photos and videos and no longer use my digital camera, the quality is better and overall experience is better, faster and easier than my canon.
Loving this phone!",LG,1
"I received my platinum grey Lg G7 ThinQ in the mail yesterday. I bought a case and screen protector and everything, set up all my information and transferred my contacts... then I went to the store today to put it on a data plan and the Verizon gentleman told me it is not compatible. Don't believe the answered questions by the manufacturer that says it's compatible with Verizon. IT IS NOT! I repeat: IT IS NOT COMPATIBLE WITH VERIZON.
Also, I was playing around with the camera last night, and the pictures really leave more to be desired. For having one of the highest MP cameras on a phone, the quality is sub-par. If a great camera is something that you want, try a different phone. My friend has a Google Pixel 3, and it takes amazing pictures effortlessly.
Other than that, the phone met functionality expectations which is the only reason why it didn't get a 1. I'm mostly rating it low because this seller is BS, and I don't want them to lie anymore on their description and questions when they're asked which networks this phone is compatible with.",LG,0
Good looking phone but it is a Spanish version of the phone and is also not compatible with Verizon. Even though they said it was compatible with Verizon. Not LGs fault that the phone was not as advertised. Am returning it in the morning.,LG,0
"Crazy good deal for $400. This display on this phone is beautiful. I'm super happy with it and it's crazy how fast the prices on last year's flagship phones have dropped. Updates on this phone will be below average(Feb 2019 patch at the time of this review), but I knew that going into this purchase and felt that it was worth it to get such good hardware at a mid range price. This phone should get android 9 Pie, probably not Q though. I wish LG was better with the updates and patches but just about any Android phone is gonna be some type of compromise. Performance on this phone is top notch, it has everything you could want- IP68, wireless charging, USB 3.1 data transfer speeds, Snapdragon 845, 3120x1440p display, Dual cameras with video recording on the Ultra wide angle lens, UFS 2.1 flash storage, Super loud speaker, 32 bit quad DAC. If you are into photography then you should side-load the Google Camera app with Night Sight because then you can really maximize the hardwares ability to capture images. All and all, I think this is a solid choice for anyone who wants a solid phone that will last a couple of years but doesn't have 800-1000 to spend on an iPhone XS or Galaxy s10. And once again, this item is a NEW Unlocked LG G7 (G710ULM).",LG,1
"Works perfectly on AT&T, very snappy phone, extremely loud audio, would buy again !",LG,1
I love the 2 full days I can go without a recharge and spending 3 to 4 hours a day using the phone. If you've got the money for this phone its a wise choice it uses both GSM and CDMA bands just depends on the sim card you put in it as Ive had both types of sim cards installed I would have preferred that the back came off or they would have sent the key to open the tray for replacing the sim card and the external storage for the price you pay it should be included but instead I had to order the sim card key from amazon too,LG,1
Is this phone cheap? No. Is this phone overly expensive? Also no. It's got a great headphone jack with a custom quad DAC chip built into the phone co-developed between ESS and LG. It will drive your higher end headphones well. It has google assistant built in. It has a decent size battery and all the latest doodads to charge it including quick charge and QI wireless charging. The processor puts it on equal footing with the S9+. Also it has this nice new feature where you can use it to place telephone calls. Crazy what they can do with technology these days.,LG,1
"I've had this phone for close to 6 months now. It's still going strong.
I got the android 9 update, and the software works nicely.
Battery life is really good. I don't even charge it at night when I don't use it much during day. When in need, a quick 30min charge with the fast charger included is enough to get back over 50%.
The phone is very responsive, just like a $800 phone. The fingerprint reader integrated in the back is very convenient.
The audio is awesome. When you connect headphones to the jack, a dedicated DAC takes over, and you can hear the difference vs my previous phone. The integrated speakers are loud enough for calls and podcasts, but you'll still want to connect to a bluetooth speaker for better sound to enjoy music.
The camera is good in bright light and has a wide angle option. But is still slow to respond to trigger, and I'm not happy with low light results. I can't give up my DSLR yet!
Overall I highly recommend this phone. You are not giving up much under $400, compared with phones double the price.",LG,1
"Phone works great. After I got the phone I called Verizon and they said the phone is not compatible with their network. I said ok. After the call I took the Sim card out of my old phone placed it in this phone and everything started working properly. Calls are crystal clear, text video and pictures messaging works fine, and no problems with data. This phone is super nice great screen resolution great picture quality. Excellent phone",LG,1
"While I have no complaints about the overall performance of the phone, it is NOT AS ADVERTISED. It's on a network called Claro and is third party unlocked. Not factory unlocked as seller claims.",LG,0
"Like the phone. Good camera. Smart phone, not as smart owner so still exploring features. Battery life is remarkable! Great photos. Have not tried fingerprint reader or face recognition yet. Had the phone exactly one week when we were in a head on wreck. Phone was in my purse which a bystander put under my head as I Iaid in street waiting for ambulance. After I was taken to hospital phone was used to photograph accident scene. Sturdy phone! Great photos (which clearly documented other party totally at fault).",LG,1
"This is an ok phone, but the battery is no good. It charges really fast; but if you make a few calls, check your social media page, OR play one good game, then the phone is giving you that ""down to 15%"" message for you to charge your phone. If the battery lasted longer, I would actually give it five stars. The face and voice recognition work 90 % of the time...which is alright with me because I also have a PIN to unlock it.",LG,0
I returned the phone because it did not work on verizon network. AT&T said the guy at the verizon store and the guy I called directly at Verizon. Just not good,LG,0
"It's a beautiful phone, but the phone is not factory unlocked. I confirmed with Motorola this phone was tied to a specific carrier and I could not activate with Google Fi. It also has no us warranty according to them. Buyer beware.",LG,0
As good or better than advertised. Was unable to get everything transferred with Verizon. Verizon pouty about buying online and not signing another worthless contract with them :-) Battery lif is unbelievable compared to the Motorla Razr that I had. Great pictures too.,LG,1
We replaced our old Samsung with this LG G7 ThinQ. What a difference. Better quality overall.,LG,1
"there is nothing this phone does not do well. Fast and good battery life. The display really is readable in bright sunlight, and the sound is very loud and clear.",LG,1
"So far it's worked nicely, sound it great. Have had a few glitches, nothing major. Battery life is average, similar to most phones. One down side is voicemail with Verizon won't work... At all.",LG,1
Bought this phone to use on at&t and it works fine. Wifi calling does not work with at&t and that's what I need to be able to use it in my house.,LG,0
It is a very nice phone,LG,1
"I recommend the phone but not the seller (ironically, LG). As many others had reported, this phone does not work on Verizon as described. It only supports GSM. I should have listened to the other reviews and saved myself the hassle.",LG,0
Installed my Verizon SIM card have a phone retrieved my info from the cloud and Google no problem Great value for what I paid!,LG,1
"This is my 4th LG phone. I really like the LG environment, but I'm not going to pay for the current flagship phone, so buying the previous model is a good option for me. The LG-G7 is a great value.",LG,1
"Excellent cellphone, works perfectly and it's very beautiful",LG,1
"I bought this for the following to replace my old Sony XZ.
1. Radio -- yes, some of us listen to the radio, but it wasn't a major factor.
2. Audio jack -- bad experience with dongles. Bluetooth don't last if you're on the phone for hours for work. This was a key factor.
3. 2 year limited warranty. This kind of sweetened the deal.
Other reasons to like this:
1. Music. I heard about the audio feature and was majorly impressed compared to my Sony XZ which I replaced this with.
Some things to get used to:
1. Getting used to the new interface coming from a different brand. Not a major issue.
2. Slightly larger than I expected. Cannot simply use my thumb to do one finger typing as much anymore. Oh well.
Overall, I was deciding between the Samsung S9 and the LG G7 ThinQ. I first came across the LG G7 while browsing at Best Buy and noticed the LG G6 on display. After researching more online, I decided on the LG G7 and purchased it online. I haven't regretted this purchase yet!",LG,1
"I got this phone as a present and really love it. Was able to try this and some of it's competitors in a store to see how each felt in my hand, how easy was it to handle, how good was the display and I took photos of the some object (my husband) at the same distance with each one.
I take quite a few pictures so I was happy so the final determiner for me was the clarity of the pictures and quality of the color without using filters. Call quality is splendid. Display is so great I don't even have to use my reading glasses.
And the different features are very fun and easy to use.
Great processor as well.",LG,1
"Last year LG made a big deal about how they were going to update their phones in a timely manner. This could not be further from the truth. Here we are in Q2 of 2019 and this phone is still on Android 8 (not even 8.1).
Coming from a pure Android before that got updates within a few months, this is a huge disappointment. LG Android customizations are more annoying than useful and hardly outweigh the new features that Android 9 has. I would gladly go to a stock Android OS if it meant they could roll out an update in a timely manner.
LG spends all of their resources making new phones (who else has 2 ""flagship"" phones at the same time that are so similar it's difficult to tell them apart?) instead of updating the phones they have and wonders why their Mobile devision is failing.",LG,0
"I am no stranger to smart phones and have been both an Android and an Iphone user. I avoided Samsung because I felt they had become bloated and overpriced and I wanted a cheaper phone that shared many Samsung Specs. So I ended up with the LG G7 which turned out to be one of the most disappointing phones ever. Here were the dissapointments in order : 1) The battery life - drained VERY quickly. Even though it speed charges I don’t always have access or time. 2) The photo quality. Terribly disappointing and worse than my 7 year old Note 3 that I still own. Massively digressed here. Not only poor quality but photo does funky things like refusing to focus on close-ups and doc scans. 3) Fingerprint sensor failed. LG said to factory reset the phone which did not help. Now I cannot login to my phone or apps/accounts with fingerprint scan. 4) Phone became very sluggish, especially when unlocking, takes a few to start. 5) Phone does not have as good of reception on same service as prior phones. 6) The screen remains on the entire time on a call. Trying to turn it off in usual manner (power button press) disconnects the call. 7) The sim / micro sd card tray is too small and takes great effort to get either one in without them popping out again.
**** UPDATE **** Literally within a week of posting this review the phone completely quit working. Cannot hard reset, cannot do anything. I've contacted LG warranty since I bought this as a brand new phone, but unless you buy from Best Buy or other ""authorized retailer"" you are out of luck. Complete dud. See the photo, I literally get a question mark on the screen when trying to turn it on, and that is it. Nevermore LG, you have been screwing people since 2015 when your flagship phone, the G4, had bootloop issues forcing users to seek service centers so they can get their devices running again",LG,0
"I recently secured a new job and after accepting it, realized rather suddenly that I'm going to have to return my current Samsung S8+ and I'll need another device. I wasn't able to get into what I really wanted (the Note 9) but I did some research and decided to go with the G7. The name, 'ThinQ' is a bit of silly name if you ask me, but oh well. My last LG phone was the G3, which I genuinely liked. I wasn't eligible for the G4 upgrade, and when the G5 modular phone came out, I had made a firm decision not to get it at all (as did most of you). I went with the Galaxy S6+, then the S7 Edge, the S8+ and I was firmly entrenched within the Samsung eco-verse, and fully expected another one was in my future. But that was not to be.
As I mentioned, I did my research and decided to go with the G7. For my budget, it was not just the best phone option, but also, probably the best phone available for that price. It has the internals of the more expensive Samsung rivals, (except only 4gb RAM instead of 6 in the S9+). The screen is almost the exact same size and that within a smaller frame, not a bad trade-off if you ask me.
I was a bit disappointed that LG hadn't fallen in line and upgraded to an OLED screen like even apple has, but I must say, that whatever LG is doing, well keep doing it because the screen is genuinely fantastic. LCD or OLED, this screen is vivid, and amazing. It can get ridiculously bright which makes the screen easily readable in virtually any light. Honestly, I cannot see the difference between it and the Super AMOLED screen on my S8+ if I'm being honest. I almost decided not to go with the LG for the LCD screen alone, but I'm glad I chose to give it a shot anyway. LG hits a home run with the G7 screen. Stunning and beautiful. The one place where OLED beats the LG however is in the deep blacks and how easily it is to save battery life by switching to a screen with more solid blacks. Not an option here, but dang, this screen shouldn't stop you from considering getting the G7 like it did me initially.
The build is top notch...but that only means in order to support wireless charging, it will have to be a bit more vulnerable than phones with all metal backs. It's a trade-off, but worth it if you know the convenience of wireless charging, trust me. Solve this issue by getting a good case that allows for wireless charging and you'll be set.
An honest-to-goodness 3.5mm headphone jack? Right when many are getting rid of them...its a bold move but one I certainly appreciated. The Quad Dac audio player is, especially for a mobile phone, just plain amazing. You're going to hear better audio with this phone, especially with earbuds and headphones than you will with arguably any mobile device out there. I love mine. It's almost worth buying for this alone.
A lot has been made of the cameras, and I found them to be pretty dang good. I don't think you're going to find much to scream about, but in my opinion, I found them to be on par with my Samsung. I haven't experimented much with it yet, but I will and may do a quick update here before too long.
The boom speaker...hmmm. A bit more underwhelming than I expected, especially considering how much LG brags about it. While it certainly gets much louder than my S8+ and I truly appreciated that, is it loud enough that you'd consider using it to watch a movie? Uhhh, no. At least I sure wouldn't. Music sounds better, but just not anywhere as good as I expected considering what I read and saw for the G7 marketing.
USB-C charging, another welcome addition, along with fast charging and wireless charging, too. Once I got used to both of these features, I'm telling you it is quite difficult to go back to something that does not offer this as a standard feature.
The multiple ways to unlock the phone is pretty impressive. You have your standard fingerprint sensor, which is just about a perfect placement since that is where your finger rests naturally most of the time anyway and wasn't LG the first to employ this feature in the first place? You can opt for using a pattern or code or even facial recognition, which I found to be much better than my S8+ and along with that, much faster. It was so unreliable, that I turned it off entirely on the S8.
Gorilla Glass 5 on front and back (I read elsewhere that they used GG 4 on back and 3 on front, but I just confirmed at LG's own site, that was incorrect) help make this very vulnerable looking phone more protected than it looks...but with that said, I still recommend a good case and screen protector (I MUCH prefer glass over the older silicone ones). Regardless of how careful you may be, it isn't a question of if, but when you will accidentally drop it and then you'll find out just how accurate their claims are regarding how tough it may be. Why take that chance? Even if you are super careful, it may be someone else handling your device who drops it--the point is, do yourself a favor and take care of it.
Speed...while it wasn't a huge step up from what I noticed with my S8+, I DID notice how smooth it seemed to be and how much less LG's skin seemed intrusive than it did back when I had the G3. I think this is a move in the right direction. ANY time you can bring a device closer to stock android, is a better move. LG seems to always be in Samsung's shadow and therefore tries to take its own spin on things and the G7 is no exception. Samsung had some fantastic themes that were exclusive to their devices and I found out the other day, the G7 has some to choose from as well. Nowhere near as many, mind you, but some were actually pretty decent...but I'd sacrifice it all for stock android.
And finally...that notch. Ever since the iPhone X came out with that notch, it seemed that you either were okay with it, or you hated it. Not many in betweeners. Say what you want about it, but if you want more screen real estate, you have 2 options, either place the camera somewhere other than on the front of the screen (some have a novel, mechanical pop-up camera) or you place it on front and work around it somehow. LG embraced this and you have the option of getting rid of it, or keeping it. I find that for most things, it simply doesn't bother me, which I found to be a surprise considering before I got it, I really thought it would bug me silly. But nope. You may be different however, which is why the option to remove it entirely is a nice touch.
The dedicated Google Now button is an almost direct ripoff of Samsung's Bixby button...except that Google Now is actually useful unlike Bixby, which most users simply turn off. It can do almost anything Google can do--just a whole lot slower. Sure, it has a few features that Google Now and Siri cannot do, but they are so slow, you may as well just do it by hand yourself. The other issue is that like Bixby, this button activates Google and nothing else. You cannot remap it to open other things that may also be super convenient for you like say the camera, or the phone etc. LG, if you want to take a leap ahead of Samsung, you're going to need to have the courage to make the decisions that Samsung refuses to do. Just sayin'.
All in all, a very underrated phone that may be hampered a bit due to LG's inability to market their devices with any kind of genuine success...which is too bad. This phone is exceptional and the equal to almost any device out there today.",LG,1
"Purchased through Verizon not Amazon, but am very happy with this phone. It replaced my droid turbo 2. I did a lot of research first and am happy I did. It's quick, has a great quality screen, takes nice pics (even in low light), and is very customizable and user friendly. Glad it still has a headphone jack and SD slot. Battery life is not unbelievable, but it seems comparable with all the other major models out there now. Also, sound quality is a little disappointing - the loud end really loses quality and sounds tinny. But overall, I would recommend to a friend and would purchase again myself.",LG,1
"The phone I received is NOT compatible with Sprint or Verizon networks. LG distributes some factory unlocked phones directly and some through Brightpoint, and the ones that come from Brightpoint are only compatible with a select few carriers, which does not include Sprint or Verizon. On the box the model number is listed as LM-G710ULMBPTPL, this model uses different LTE and CDMA bands that do not work with most US carriers. LG really should list these models separately. I spent nearly two hours on the phone with Amazon, LG, and Sprint trying to get this phone to activate and it is not possible, because this phone is not compatible.",LG,0
"A 6000 mAh power bank battery is absolutely necessary if you are away from a power source for more than 4 hours. When I'm playing games, the battery rarely lasts over 4 hours. If you are playing or watching shows in bright daylight, the battery will be depleted within 2.5 hours.
Photos are above average with good low light performance and excellent daylight performance. Back-lit images are washed out and just terrible. Auto focus is weak, so you have to manually touch the screen before most shots.
That said, I love that I was able to buy a phone with a Snapdragon 845 processor and 4 Gigs of memory for under $400 (elsewhere)- those are flagship specs as of early 2019. The longer screen means you lose a lot of horizontal real estate compared to other 6 inch phones, but it helps you enjoy movies shot in 16:9 ratio. The screen on boosted mode is bright enough for direct daylight even with polarized sunglasses.
The waterproofing rating allows it to be taken on snorkeling trips as well as into the shower. I've never had a single program run slowly in the 6 months since I bought it. Passmark benchmarks put it at the top 90% of phones in the market. I would recommend this if you are on a budget, and don't mind 2X, or 3X a day recharging. Fortunately, as long as you have a 2 Amp or faster charger, this phone fully charges within 60 minutes. 1A charging ports require at least 3 hours.",LG,0
"got mine used, it didn't come with any accessories but I have found no blemishes... I can buy accessories xD
ANYWAY my biggest complaint is it's still on Android 8 Oreo! C'mon LG and this is on Google Fi it's fully endorsed by GOOGLE I did not expect that :/. Android 9 should come but Android 10 is out so... c'mon LG worst support EVER (for a flagship device). 16:9 videos UNDERSTANDABLY don't fill the 18:9 screen (I don't know what I was expecting...). The camera (though NOT something I know much about) is really not that great... word is due to software overhead (Android 9 where are you??)... but the one shot I took was SO blurry, if I really cared though I could find a better app to use and so on but default it SUCKS (I hear it gets pretty good though...). OK it MIGHT be a little unresponsive of a touchscreen too- I've noticed on my tappy tap tap game it sometimes takes 3 or 4 taps to find the 'hotspot'... I mean maybe it's me but... my history with LG is like this so... it could be the software? I will update when I mod the phone if it is actually a thing... also part is cuz I'm not used to such a small bezel like where does the screen end? so I could be touching the bezel.
That's a short set of negatives on a 300 dollar (400 new) phone though, pluses include WIDESCREEN camera- not that I care about that but it seems to be all the rage, a BOOMIN speaker (just 1 speaker mind you... but I can HEAR IT IN THE SHOWER without bringing it into the actual shower that is LOUD) that's basically a bluetooth speaker, quad dac that makes my $50 100 ohm Yamahas sound like $500 Bose (overpriced but hey! you get the idea- Bose headphones are better quality than their speakers though), super bright screen I can see outside and a great 5+ hour screen on time (basically all day battery).
So with it being SUPER affordable with plus specs AND Google certified (though slow updates :/ I believe they will come eventually) I count 3 negs (not counting the aspect ratio one... that's an android issue really) to 5 positives HIGHLY recomended!",LG,0
"Phone (or, its USB-C port, which is the same thing) died within 7 months. LG won't replace the faulty product, which means you have to be without a phone for 2+ weeks (they ship ground, no fancy air shipping for them).
The punchline? The replacement phone (a refurb) I bought to hold me over has a problematic USB-C port as well. That makes it 2 out of 2.",LG,0
"I needed an unlocked phone and had not a clue what to get. Spent a great deal of time reading reviews and comparing stats. Narrowed it down to 4 and went to see them locally where I could see them in person side by side. Took a photo of the same object and it made the choice easy. All things being equal, this phone had the better processor and quality of photographs. The display, it's so clear. Calls are perfections.",LG,1
"I have had this phone (bought unlocked online just like this one here) for over a year and I love it. I have no idea why it's got such a mediocre rating here. Sure, the camera quality is not as good as Samsung or iPhone, but the wide angle lens MORE THAN makes up for that! See attached!
The quad DAC was the main reason I switched from Samsung to LG and I'm not disappointed. It really does sound awesome when you plug in a nice pair of wired headphones! Note: you don't get the benefits of the quad DAC without a wired headset.",LG,1
Claro Network? TF is that? This phone has not been unlocked for usage with Sprint network in the U.S. Be gone with you.,LG,0
"I love the IPS screen. It is very pleasing and easy on the eyes.
The phone is slightly narrow which is nice. Less wide makes it easier to use.
Headphone jack is nice to have.",LG,1
"Great phone. What else is there to say? And LG has excellent sound, even better than HTC in their golden age. Comes with a very good DAC.",LG,1
"I have now had two experiences with them that were both around their horrible design for SIM card handling. On the G6, they have such a flimsy SIM card tray that they routinely break and often that is inside the phone...damaging contacts as you try to pull the mangled tray out. Do a quick search and you will see how many vendors offer replacement trays, and how many users are screwed by the thing breaking inside the phone. That is then YOUR problem, because it is ""physical damage"", and is not covered by their warranty program. Add to that the repair policy of it taking 2 weeks to turn your repair around (so yu have no phone) and the result is:
I will NEVER buy another LG phone, and I strongly suggest you also avoid their products!!!!",LG,0
"Does not preform like a phone of this spec should. The battery life is absolutely abhorrent, the fingerprint sensor is slow and very inconsistent, and the software experience is very buggy. The camera app is constantly crashing. The normal camera has A very narrow field of view but can take good pictures. The wide angle camera is of horrible quality. The selfie camera is awful. Snapchat videos and pictures are laggy frame rate dropping messes. And trying to watch videos is a constant drag and buffer freezing disaster. And it's not internet related, I have other devices on the same source that play the same video flawlessly. Its just this phone. Its awful. No screen protector fits it right either. And the mono bottom firing speaker is trash! Phone calls are super quiet even on max volume. This phone is awful!",LG,0
"Received the phone unlocked and new as promised. However, there are still other issues:
You can't update the phone outside of AT&T network. Because this phone is still new in its box, its on an old android 8 version. If you want to update the phone, you need to connect to the ATT network with an ATT sim. LG and ATT have designed it this way. You won't be able to update it any other way, and the bootloader is locked. Supposedly it is possible to flash other firmwares onto the phone, but of course this isn't supported by LG.
To do this, I had to obtain a ATT sim from walmart ($10 at walmart, 5$ from ATT) and a prepaid card (you can use a $10 prepaid card, but I found out they allow you to activate a single-day plan for only $2)
That cost me $20, although it should be possible to do for $7. Either way, its stupid that I have to go through this just to update the phone. Shame on you ATT, and to LG for going along with it.
Anyways, about the phone itself:
This phone is at least 1 year old with a non-removable battery. After charging it a few times and measuring it with accubattery, the battery has lost 10% of its health, effectively making it a 3000mAh battery.
Aside from that, this is an amazing phone. Its easily one of the best values for the price. The OLED screen is beautiful, it makes me want to re-watch everything I've ever seen using this screen. It plays all of the games I used to play on my V20, but with higher settings and is very smooth.
The design is meh. I hate that every manufacturer feels the need to copy Apple's decisions. Nobody feels that they could stick to their guns or try to make a unique design. (Motorola's new flip-phone looks pretty neat though) I really with it was closer to the V20 in design, or some of the old HTC phones. But overall, the phone is really great.
The sad thing is, this is the best high-end value phone LG currently has. (The V20 and V30 are still good if you're fine with their age)
The V40? A new V40 (GSM version) costs over $600 (CDMA version is $330, if you're willing to switch), and is basically the same phone but with 3 cameras instead of 2.
The G7? An IPS screen and only 4GB RAM. For the same price, its just not worth it. Especially now that I've experienced the OLED screen, I can't go back. The difference between these two phones is ridiculous considering these phones released only one month apart from each other. The V35 is basically a really hasty correction to the G7 when LG realized they released a sub-par phone.
The G8? Hardware-wise, the G8 is a slight upgrade, with Snapdragon 855(vs.845), 128GB, and an extra camera. Its about $180 more than the V35 though. (Used ones are at $320-340, if you're willing to accept the risk then it might be worth it.) If only the V35 wasn't so tied to AT&T, I believe it would be much more popular as a $300 phone.",LG,0
"This phone is GSM unlocked. Worked with my T-Mobile sim just fine. No notches, nice light weight especially if you're worried about a case making it too heavy.Unfortunately it was stuck on Android 8.0 with November 2018 security patch. It should have updated to Android 9. Maybe if you try an AT&T sim card it'll go through the update. These days you can't underestimate security risks in phones.",LG,0
"I have complete removed and updated my review on this phone and updated my rating from four to five stars.
This phone is brand new. I was concerned because of the seller listing these phones under a dozen different seller names that are all the same company and many reviewers complaining that they received a used phone. (I suspect they unknowingly ordered a used/renewed phone or possibly inventory got mixed up when the seller shipped them to Amazon.) If you ordered new and got used just send it back for replacement. Mine was sealed in the ATT box and came with everything expected.
While waiting for my number to be ported to AT&T I hooked up to my wifi and that took no effort at all. I went through uninstalling or disabling apps and games I don’t want and customized the phones settings and home screen to my liking. I was prepared to restore my data from a backup on my SD card, but found that it was unnecessary. Instead, I installed AT&T Mobile Transfer on my old phone and using the Setup and Transfer app on the ThinQ I easily transferred all my data over to the new phone via wifi. Any apps I had installed were of course updated with google play. I immediately noticed that the phone was blazing fast compared to my old LG Stylo 2, but maybe that isn’t saying much. (I miss my stylus.) I haven’t put it through any real stress test yet, but I did fully charge the battery and then started streaming a movie. I kept checking the battery and it seemed fixed at 99%. I didn’t watch to long, but my old Stylo 2 drained like a bathtub when streaming a movie. Using LG Airdrive on the phone and LG Bridge on my laptop I could easily browse files on my phone and transfer things to and from the laptop such as photos, music and movies. Is there anything that isn’t easy with this phone?
Well, the bio metric sensor can exercise your patience. It doesn't seem to have to many issues reading finger prints - once it's learned them. Teaching it I found to be rather tedious. I probably saw 'The sensor needs to be cleaned' a thousand times. I cleaned the sensor. I scrubbed my hands. Eventually, I was able to get five fingers learned. Nice to have backups. The manual states there will be an issue if you have a scar. It's not kidding. I have a scar right down the center of the pad of my left index finger and the sensor had a heck of a time learning it. However, once it learned any of my prints, including the scarred finger, they all did unlock the phone, but not with consistency. Sometimes one touch and the phone is unlocked. Other times I touch each finger that the phone has learned and none of them unlock the phone so I have to go to the secondary method I chose. I'll work on it.
Wifi calling does work. I tested on my home internet which is pretty lousy and the call kept breaking up, but that's my internets issue not the phones. I see no reason to use wifi with my unlimited plan anyway. I guess if I'm in an area where there is no cell service it might come in handy, but odds are that if there is no cell service it is unlikely that any wifi will be nearby.
Hotspot worked like a charm as well. I hooked both my laptop and TV up with no issues. Download speed was only about 5Mb, but when my internet is down or we have a power outage it's better than nothing.
Once my phone number was ported over to ATT I made some calls. They hear me fine and I hear them fine.
The phone handled streaming from Amazon Prime with flying colors. I kept hearing about the great sound on this phone. I wasn't impressed, but who doesn't use buds when listening to music anyway.
This does come with Android 8. Repeated attempts to update to 9 failed. The phone tells me the software is up to date. Last updated says 'never updated'. ATT did release 9 for the V35 months ago and ATT is my provider/carrier. Not Cricket or any other MVNO. I seriously considered going to the ATT store to have the update manually done, but I live outside of town so I plan my trips to town when I have several reasons to go. I never got that far.
I had started my prepaid promotional plan with ATT and paid upfront for a year of service. Five days later ATT billed me a second time. I did call ATT and work out the issue, but something else happened at this point. I made my daily attempt to update my phones software and lo and behold it started updating. My phone came with V350AWM10w. The update skipped 12a and updated to 12e. I updated again and got 12j. The next update skipped 12k and updated to 20b. I now have Android 9! I do another update to 20c and one last update to V350AWM20d. That’s the most current software. I suspect I just had to wait for ATT to properly put my new phone in the system. When they did that they erroneously charged me again, but I fixed that. So apparently in order to get the updates you just need to be patient. Not my forte. I did notice that when the phone was sitting on my wireless charger during updates the phone got pretty warm. It did not get warm doing updates when not on the charger. I don't know why.
I mentioned LG Bridge earlier. Install on your PC. It works just fine and makes it extremely easy to move files to and from the phone. It supposedly can be used for software update by connecting your phone to your computer with a USB cable, but I tried during my marathon updating and it wouldn’t work so I just did all the updates from my phone. LG Bridge connects to your phone using your phones LG AirDrive too. Air Drive isn’t exactly an app. You find it in your settings under network. This gives you access to the files on your phone like songs and pictures which you can just grab and drop onto your PC. LG Bridge also connects to your V35 via USB cable to perform backups which will be kept on your PC of coourse.
I checked out my phone online and found that it was manufactured October 2018 and left the factory December 2018. It apparently sat on the shelf until I bought it which explains why it was so far behind in updates.
I have absolutely no complaint with this brand new phone. It’s clean. It’s fast. Everything works flawlessly, except maybe that bio metric reader when sticking your fingerprint on there, but I doubt that's something unique to this phone. It's just something I'll need to work on. I believe my issue is with my dry hands and fingers.
My only two issues were ATT issues. (Double billing and waiting for the software update to Android 9.) I thought this deal was to good to be true and I would have lots of problems and be dissatisfied with the phone, but it turned out to be a great deal on a great phone. I couldn’t have made a better decision making this purchase. I say you should take the plunge and purchase this phone because you will get a brand new phone that works great. It's being sold at a great price so you should get one before they're gone.",LG,1
"I'm NET10 user(SIM is compartable for AT&T) so, I have to set up APN for getting NET10 data service. It took for a while because I had to find out the correct one (NET10 doesn't provide it on their website anymore so, I had to Google it.lol). This brand-new phone works PERFECT for me. I loved my previous LG G5 but this one is way better. There is no problems, so far so good working. Worthy shopping!",LG,1
"I've seen many different reviews for this item but none state what company there device came from. Mine came from Wireless warehouse. The phone was new in a sealed box. The phone has worked flawlessly so far. The phone is much faster than my previous phone a Stylo 3. Apps open immediately moving between apps is fast with no delays. A pleasure to use. The screen is beautiful and bright. Battery life has been great. The camera takes nice pictures. I haven't used it a lot. I have a Nikon camera with a nice lens on it that I use for taking pictures. This an AT&T phone with included AT&T bloatware. There isn't a lot of it and the 64gb storage still leaves you with plenty of free storage. Some you can uninstall. The rest I just disabled or move to a folder.
I went to AT&T and bought a pay as you go number. I then upgraded to Android 9.0 no problems. Had to restart the phone about 10 times for all the updates. One thing I didn't like is that it wouldn't update over cellular data. It would only use WiFi. So I might not have had to get an AT&T number. the update went smooth with no problems. I bought the AT&T number because some people have said that you had to.
When that was finished I put my old sim in the phone and it came right up and worked fine. I'm with Walmart family mobile. I had called them and asked if it would work on the network. They said I would have to get a new sim from them. That is not true. Everything is working fine. The only thing that is not working is WiFi calling. Mobile hotspot is working great. Coverage is the same as the Stylo 3. I had to enter the apn codes. You can find them on the Walmart site. I haven't tried the wireless charging yet so I can't comment on that.
So I would say that I am very pleased with this purchase and would recommend this phone and seller without hesitation.",LG,1
"Original, ATT branded, unopened new device. Seller Wireless Tech. I already have ATT, so can't determine if truly unlocked, but for under $300, this phone is a smoker, must have performance. Put it this way, original price of this phone a little over year ago was $900!! Would I pay that? No. But at $300 dollars you are getting flagship device which can still compete with today's overpriced options. Get it.",LG,1
Brand spanking new phone. Works great. Been using about a month now. Super happy with purchase.,LG,1
"I had been eyeing between this and the v40 ThinQ. The battery is slightly better than the v40 but the v40 is more powerful in terms of performance of running Apps, in my opinion. It's also REALLY BRIGHT at max brightness, compared to the v40. My eyes were just blinded by light.
I bought this phone last week and I'm only going to use it as a 2nd device for music or playing mobile games. Which so far, mobile games load up almost 50% faster on the v35 than the v40. However, there's a drop due to the graphics settings, depending on the App. I still need to wait on the case for the v35 because the phone is about 1/3 thinner than the v40. My other complaint on the v35 is the fact the fingerprint reader is also the power key. Which I feel is really impractical. It's like finding a house that's only held in the middle of the air by a single staircase. So I'd only use the Fingerprint Scanner as the Power Key.
Overall though, it's a pretty neat phone. But good lord, it's really sleek enough to slip off my hands if I'm not careful. A sturdy case is definitely recommended.",LG,1
"I have had the LG G5 for many years, but dropped it recently and broke the screen - so I thought I'd rather upgrade! My G5 was COMPLETELY virgin - no bloatware, just pristine Android phone, that I bought on Amazon for $250 several years ago. It was completely unlocked, and since I travel to Europe a LOT, I always used local EU SIMs and G5 always worked like a charm, including tethering - which I use a LOT to connect my laptop to my phone. So, the LG V35 ThinQ is an awesome phone - I loved it .... until, I started testing the functionality that I must have. It worked out of the box on my Cricket Wireless SIM, it also by default enabled wifi calling on Cricket Wireless, however it would not up allow me to even start tethering unless I have an ATT SIM. This was really shocking ... shame on ATT on blocking basic Andriod functionality by installing their ROM and blocking built-in Android features! So, sadly, I ended up returning the phone!
If someone's figured out how to get tethering working without ATT SIM card, please let me know. I don't mind blowing away all the bloatware from ATT just once and for all. However, I must have tethering working for the phone to be useful to me.
It's a shame that ATT is so cheap and ripping off customers .... otherwise, it's a great phone and I'd buy it again.",LG,1
"I was waiting for the delivery- it was personally handed to me on my porch - so no drop no issues on delivery with that. The item appeared as new - mfg box appeared sealed. It was only after discovering defects I noticed there was no mfg seal on screen or ports - AGAIN - it was advertised and sold as a NEW phone. I spent an entire day updating and calling LG etc - the external speaker never worked. It was deemed by LG to be a faulty or badly ""renewed"" phone. I wasted a vacation day trying to update the system and hoping it would work.t did not. I then had to explain my return to Amazon - I am a prime member who buys high end products regularly. My payment went through immediately - my refund not so much. All in all - this was NOT a good experience. I have reordered the phone and am prayerful my zero balance (no refund yet) wont become an even bigger issue and that the next ""New"" one I ordered wont be defective as well. #FeelingSuspectfulofNewBrandedItems and alo #SlowAmazon3rdpartrefund",LG,0
Excellent. The real thing was delivered. I was disappointed by a earlier purchase of a phablet. I checked youtube and online videos of persons usage of the best phones and this one topped the list. I had an older LG for a long time and finally gave in to purchasing a new phone. The LG Thin Q is great! The order came shipped from the seller without any issues or problems. I love it. The apps and video clarity is most excellent. The battery will last over 16 hours of regular use and charges to full percent in about 20 minutes. The only thing I do not like about it is that pages of your last usage pop up in the background but if you want to use other tools or take notes while using the camera it shuts off.,LG,1
Just as description. You will be satisfied,LG,1
I dont know if anybody is even reading this but my experience with purchasing this phone from this seller was great even though this is an att n t phone it is unlocked and as you can see in the pics that the phone is on tmobiles network the phone did come with scratches on the screen but it didnt bother me i just put a screen protector on it and the phone does come with bloatware from the carrier and i got android 9 pie out of the box but im not too sure if this device will get android 10,LG,1
"Not a unlocked phone. Arrived in a timely manner, but when I tried to activate it on metropcs (T-Mobile) I discovered that it was not unlocked. AT&T would not unlock the phone, and I ended up returning the phone the day after it arrived.",LG,0
"WARNING THIS PHONE IS AN AT&T PHONE IT DOES NOT WORK WITH ANYTHING ELSE VERY GOOD BECAUSE IT MAY BE A RELEASED PHONE INSTEAD OF A UNLOCKED PHONE. LOTS OF BLOATWARE.
ALSO YOU CAN'T PUT IT IN A FACTORY MODE TO WIPE THE CASH AND DO OTHER TESTS ON THE PHONE. KINDA DISAPPOINTED THAT IT DIDN'T SAY THAT👎",LG,0
"Fantastic cell phone, very user-friendly, The delivery was on time, well packaged.",LG,1
"Stopped working within 2 days, contacted seller and Never heard back. Never buying from them again.",LG,0
Excellent phone for the price. I would recommend this to anyone upgrading from an older phone like the galaxy s7 that does not want to spend $700 to $1000 for a flagship phone.,LG,1
"Why is it so hard to find phones without bloatware you cant delete. ATT's crap is all over this phone.
V35 is a great phone however and glad I got one.",LG,1

Its not unlocked .. works only with with AT&T .. does not work with any other carriers.,LG,0
The product is very good,LG,1
"First a warning, I bought this phone unlocked because although it's an AT&T phone, our account is T-mobile. It does work, but because the firmware is with another carrier, it doesn't work as as seamlessly as a T-Mobile phone would. That said, this is a very nice phone. It's fast, lightweight and attractive. All in all a great value, despite some minor limitations.",LG,0
I've had the phone for over a month and a half now and I really do like it. I use to have lg Optimus g pro for 7 years and I really loved that phone too. Its similar in ways but this phone is better and im glad I did my research,LG,1
"$300, Great price for a high end phone.",LG,1
Great phone for the price! Good camera. Lots of storage. Couldn't ask for more for the money paid.,LG,1
for the price you really cannot beat this phone. It competes with phones twice the price. Mine came brand new. Battery life is excellent. Nicest phone I have owned to date and I used to be a Samsung fan...just no longer see the reason to pay more.,LG,1

"Got this to replace a Pixel 2. Much smoother, faster, a bigger screen yet is light weight. LG's features and many settings are nice to have. I have had it 4 months as my daily phone without any problems. Sound system is great. I registered it on the LG site and bingo, a 2 year warranty. Can't beat that.
Update: Its been 9 months and the phone still works great with no problems. I have a couple of cases for it but I like using it without one.",LG,1
LG products are the worst on the market..both the stylo 4 and styko 5 I owned failed within weeks..there must be sone systemic issues with their manufacturing process..,LG,0
"For the price, this phone is phenomenal. I received my device brand new in box, with all original components in tact and new as well. Yes, this is an unlocked AT&T device, so there will be an AT&T logo on startup and a couple carrier specific apps, most of which can be disabled and hidden through app settings. However, the phone is certainly unlocked and works great with T-Mobile for me.
Camera: The camera is probably the best I've ever personally seen on a smartphone that takes incredible shots with little effort. Videos are gorgeous and smooth thanks to the excellent hardware and onboard optical image stabilization. There are plenty of features to play with if you're into that, but the phone can point and shoot just as easily. Pictures are crisp and contain a lot of detail and the image processing does a great job of not blowing out images. Exposure is good and low light shots are very good. The pro video mode is great for creatung some very professional looking videos with ease, and the phone even has adaptive microphones for changing soundscapes from concerts to quiet nature scenes. Laser autofocus is fast and efficient. Honestly could not ask for a better camera at this price.
Battery: Easy win here. With heavy use on wifi, I average between 6-7 hours of screen on time. Even if you are a power user, you should have no issue getting through the day on the 3300 mAh battery. Even if you do manage to burn through that much battery, the included quick charger will easily get you 50 percent battery in 35ish minutes in my experience. Wireless charging is also here which is a great convenient option.
Display: The display is a 2k AMOLED panel provided by Samung (To the best of my knowledge). The display is sharp and color reproduction is awesome. You can adjust the resolution from 760p to 1080p to the max of 1440p. The screen is very bright and easily readable outdoors in direct sunlight. Great display.
Build quality: Outstanding. Glass front and back with aluminum sides. Everything is spot on here. No large gaps or out of place pieces. Beautiful device all around. Buttons are clicky and tactile. The fingerprint reader is very fast and extremely accurate and is also the power button which is essentially LG's signature design feature and it works well.
Overall: Unbeatable value considering this phone was over $700 USD at launch. I would venture to say it's definitely worth more than what you'll pay here. Highly recommend this device.",LG,1
"I've been using this LG a little more than a month now and I'd be hard pressed to find anything to complain about. I was a Samsung user for years and finally decided that they weren't worth the hefty price tag and took a chance on this. I absolutely LOVE it. I will say I disabled Alexa - but, that's only because we have multiple Echo devices in our house and the LG wanted to respond to inquiries as well. I also have the Echo Auto and there seemed to be a conflict with both active at the same time.
IMHO, this is an incredible device - battery life is outstanding, it's loaded with features you won't likely find on your Samsung or iphone. I found a side by side comparison online between the LG V35 ThinQ and the iphone 10 - the LG beat it hands down.
LOVE this device!",LG,0
"My LG V35 cell phone arrived on time and works perfectly. Beautiful phone with all items in
the factory sealed packaging. I expect to not have any issues with this product. Again stunning phone!!",LG,1
"The screen and speed are important .. .hence the 4 stars. But the other stuff it boasts like fast charging and battery life? Well mine is either defective or they are embellishing those features. It is taking FOREVER to charge it and was using it (ok it was on full brightness but come on) for an hour and burned through 28% of the battery life! That just seems wrong! Anyway, maybe it needs to warm up. Still a zippy phone with a crisp, beautiful screen ... I think I'll keep it ... for now. Oh yeah, lacking features like gestures and such. Unimpressive set of tools. Oh well.
And an update: If you rely on vibration for text notifications, don't get this phone. The vibration can be strong, but for text I could not figure out a way to adjust it ... It is just too short and light of a burst. If someone can figure this out, please comment on this review and let me know. It's killing me that this is such a lame part of this phone as my phone is almost always set to vibrate because of where I work.",LG,0
"I had an LG V20 for four years. Loved it. Thought I'd stick with LG. The screen color is dull. Put the same pic as my wallpaper on this phone and it was washed out. Not as bright as a Samsung 8 or my other LG. I found I kept missing calls. The phone rang but I didn't hear or catch it but the swipe down notifications did not say missed call nor did the icon have a red number by it to tell me how many calls I missed. I had to go to the call log to see that. I missed several important calls! The battery life is just okay. Better than my V20 but way less than a Samsung. I bought a Samsung 8 and used it for two weeks. I wanted to go back to the double tap to wake up. Called customer service for help with the call notication and they did could not help the notification problem and suggested a factory reset. I said nope, I'll just return it to Amazon!",LG,1
"Absolutely fantastic phone! ... especially for under $300. I’ve seen some reports of problems with the fingerprint sensor, mine took several samples of my fingerprint to account for the print not always being perfectly centered. It always recognizes my fingerprint very quickly. Camera seems pretty good but I wouldn’t use a phone for any important pictures. I’ve seen reports of it not updating to Android 9, mine updated to 9 on the 3rd update attempt, I assume after some security updates. Battery life is a day with a good bit of use, 2 with moderate use, 3 with light use (I'm on 3 days with light to very light use at 65% battery). Processor is very fast. Has a 2 year warranty with LG if registered. I can’t imagine anyone having a complaint about this phone if they have the same one that I have.",LG,1
"The phone was functioning perfectly but it broke after a little over a month having it. The screen went completely black, I could still hear the noises it makes when locking and unlocking, but no calls and messages would go through.
I contacted the seller and they said I couldn't return it because I've had it for over 30 days, which is what Amazon Terms say too. But I think is quite ridiculous to have this kind of terms for electronics. I say, give it at least 90 days.
I was able to get 80% of my money back after complaining and calling Amazon SEVERAL times.
I ended up going to ATT and buying it there. Because I really liked the phone, the problem is that these phones are refurbished (another reason to give 90 days instead of 30)",LG,0
"So I am a Consumer Cellular user. No contract, have been for over 10 years. Bought my own unlocked ATT phone and took it to Target for the sim card and was up and running in 10 minutes! The biggest thing is the awesome battery life and the quality of the photos. I'm not an old person but I don't have tons of stuff on my phone, tunes, audible books and photos. Works great for me.",LG,1
Everything on this phone works well. Great screen. I like this better than my one plus 7 pro. This phone is well worth it.,LG,1
Nice phone. Works great except it is not fully unlocked as stated. Some of the AT&T features are still functional and unable to receive pics on sms. Also won’t let us into voicemail. Other than these issues it’s a great phone. Going to AT&T store tomorrow and hopefully they can fix it.,LG,1

This phone is fast and powerfull great machine.,LG,1
Good phone with galaxy features for half the price.,LG,1
When I bought this LG v35 thinq it came with a free second year warranty. My phone's on/off button/fingerprint reader began to not function intermittently. This occurred after owning the phone about 14 months. I tried to get a replacement as per the 2nd year warranty. Ultimately LG refused my claim stating I must have damaged the phone in water or by dropping the phone. Totally untrue--not dropped or wet. They just came to that conclusion without explanation. I won't be buying LG products anymore.,LG,0
The phone looked and seemed to work well for its age and price. The only issue is it DOES NOT work with T-Mobile. It is a gsm unlocked phone but not comparable with their services.,LG,0
"I use my phone for business and was interested in the stylus part. A lot of what I do is making notes on photos. I also tether devices occasionally. This phone exceeded my expectations. I have been a smartphone user since their inception and the LG G vista 2, while not the latest and greatest, is very much worth the money. The Samsung note5, the only worthy competitor, is better but 2.5xs the price and the better features (pressure sensitive stylus etc..) are not needed for my use. I have found the phone fast and 'snappy' and have had no issues with email, text or any android function. I suspect that the upcoming lg stylus 3 will be better, but again only marginally. The G vista 2's call quality, browsing, streaming, emailing are all quite good. If you need the latest and greatest your still waiting for the note 8 or stylus3, but in either case this will do handsomely until one is ready to fork over $600+ for that nicety.",LG,1
"nice phone until my daughter locked herself out and forgot the password, even factory reset will not unlocked, neither will any cell phone stores. so don't forget your password!",LG,1
"I thought I was moving up from a BLU phone, but this is worse. In 6 months the USB connection wore out, making the phone instantly disposable. The battery life brand new out of the box didn't even last a work day with a handfull of calls. It often gets hot in my pocket. (perhaps when see below) On full screen brightness I you can't watch a single1hr episode on Netflix before the battery dies. Full screen brightness is required in anyplace except a dark room.
But worst of all is the 'two tap' system to activate the phone. It is constantly activating in my pocket to the sounds of Netflix, Google Assist or music suddenly are blaring from my pocket. I oten open my phone to find 10-15 apps open, which can't help battery life.
Thought I was moving up from BLU phones. This is the same junk.",LG,0
"This is, for the price and in general a good enough phone but it doesn't have international roaming data as it claims. That was the whole reason I bought the phone...to have data while traveling abroad so I could use Google maps. The text and call features worked but the data never did. Consequently, we got lost in London and Dublin and didn't get to do even half of what we had planned. THEN, it randomly ejected the sim card after one day so I couldn't call to get a cab. After that it wouldn't accept the sim card anymore. COMPLETE waste of money and so much time lost on the vacation that I've been planning for three years!",LG,0
"I loved it at first. Worked really well. But it over heats and gets really hot. Easily to break, dropped it off my bed and broke a corner of the screen which getting too hot helped with cracking of screen. Have to shut it down all the time and either restart or completely off for a.few. Has many problems and I would never buy one again. I'm think about returning to my old phone that I have here that I've had for years and dropped tons but works awesome. Way better then this phone.",LG,0
"CONS: The SELLER should have Packaged it Better, It came in Its Original Box, But It was put inside a Plastic Shipping Bag. It should have been Bubble Wrapped & Boxed to better Protect the Phone.
PROS: I just Received this phone a day ago, The Phone Arrived very Quickly. I had LG Phones before and was Pleased, I love all the Features this Phone Offers for an Inexpensive Price.

This phone is not worth buying. I have had problems with mine ever since I got it. It calls 911 by itself and hangs up phone calls. It gets really hot and freezes a lot even though I have nothing on the phone. I will not be buying this phone again and I wouldn't recommend it to anyone.,LG,0

This is a great phone and the price is awesome. Especially since AT&T is selling it for twice the price and if you get it through their next program it'll cost more. My only negative thing about this phone is the color of the pictures. They have a pinkish/reddish light to them no matter how you adjust the settings.

"Great phone! Works well and I do not have any of the issues others reported here on Amazon but there is one draw back for me. The battery life isn't all the good at all and I am comparing this to the note 5/7. Yes, I had both and after I returned the Note 7 and I wanted to buy the Note 5 again but they were out of stock so I ended up with the LG Vista 2 and honestly it's a great alternative. I love it an dam happy with it over all but again the battery life is by far the greatest draw back for me.",LG,1

The t-mobile Hotspot does not work (same t-mobile SIM works just fine on my LG G3/D855 phone!)
The TING Hotspot does not work (same t-mobile SIM works just fine on my LG G3/D855 phone!)a
I called LG (Jun 20, 2016) and the tech.support said they are working on an update of the firmware to resolve this known isue and a few more.
I could not find a way to root this phone either, this would allow to remove ATT junkware which does not help on non ATT networks.his
Conclusion: This phone is very nice, but stay away from it, == unless you plan ATT Only use ===!
Hopefully LG Will provide a way to reflash this phone so it could be REALLY unlocked.",LG,1

I got annoyed with the Samsung J3 bloatware slowing it down so I tried this one. This is the best cheap under $100 phone I've ever had. The fact that I only had to pay $49 is even better. I've used it for 4 months without it getting bogged down. I heavy rely on Google maps and street view and this does great.,LG,1

"A few months ago, I bought the same type of phone from Tracfone; and everything worked fine. However, this time when I bought it from Total Wireless, the phone was defective. The device itself worked fine, however it was not able to connect to Wi-Fi; despite the fact that I entered the correct password for the corresponding Wi-Fi network.",LG,0
My son loves this to download games,LG,1
"The original review still stands, but two months in the screen started having extreme burn in. If you're in a pinch, this is definitely worth it, but the screen issue has me skeptical of purchasing the same phone again. It may be an isolated issue but it's a cheap phone do I doubt that's the reason. I wouldn't count on it after 6 months. Although I am a very heavy user. I was worried it wouldn't play games like Clash Royale, PUBG and others but they play very well considering! It's very smooth in terms of all the apps any Movie/Gaming enthusiast would like, and the screen is similar to the quality of my old iPhone 6(Edited). It's a solid phone for the price! The only cons are the camera which isn't terrible, but it's definitely not as good as high end phones, and the speaker quality. Otherwise great buy! I would recommend!",LG,0
"For the price this phone comes with decent budget specs, Android Oreo, and a 720p display. Performance wise it's smooth for general use like emails, calls/text, chrome, and light gaming(plays most light games on medium settings i.e Dead Trigger 2 or Temple Run). 720p display is TFT so not full IPS but it has pretty good viewing angles in general. Only cons I would list are this is one of the first phones where I notice the screen can get dirty easily and it is carrier locked into CDMA.",LG,0

"Everything works great except for the headphone connector.
There wasn't any cause for damage as far as I know. Never dropped the phone or mishandled it any forceful way.
It just doesn't work anymore.
Other than this issue there is no other complaints about the product.
Luckly I've had already ordered and received bluetooth headphones.",LG,0
"I bought this phone just to use for music, apps, camera etc. I must say, this is actually a solid phone for my needs. The battery life is impressive, video quality is solid, and the phone is overall pretty quick. The microphone (when you record videos) sounds a little different in terms of quality, but that's the only complaint I have. Good job.",LG,1
"I love it - fast, works well, good reception, nice camera. I loled it so much that I got one for my husband and one for my daughter too. The monthly service fees are super reasonable. This is a seriously nice phone for the price.",LG,1

"This phone has great specs but is very clunky and hard to use on the go.
The good:
You probably already seen how amazing this phone is on YouTube or other reviews, so im going straight to the point.
The bad:
- My number one complaint is the fingerprint reader. Its slow compared to my old phone (pixel 2xl) and it works like 50% of the time. Even after programming fingerprints multiple times its vey frustrating.
- requires a special addaptor tip to charge the phone when using the dual screen case. (Each tip is 7.99 + shipping from lg)
- said special adaptor tip doesn't work 100% with Android auto. Connection drops every two minutes or ""no response"" message pops up on the stereo
- all glass construction makes it extremely slippery if not using a case or the dual screen case (this is my first all glass phone, maybe this is normal or expected)
- Always on display is limited on info displayed and customisation options (it can display pictures, some notifications and clock.)
- selfie camera its not a true 32mp it downsizes files to 8mp
-dual screen turns off if battery is below 15% even if its plugged to the charger. Must wait for 16% battery charge
-its running android 9, who knows when the android 10 update is coming out. In the mean time android 11 beta is already out for some phones.
-Using the dual screen eats up the battery
- Display behind the dual screen has the resolution of a calculator and only has space for 3 notification icons
All in all is a good phone with good specs but in practice its really cluncky and akward to use. Would not recomend. Save your money.",LG,1
"I really enjoy this phone. To start off with, I'm not an android officiando but I love the dual screen feature of this phone. It is so mucb better than split screen to operate mutiple apps at once. I've had moments where I'm thinking ""Ok. I need to get off this app to get on this one."" only to realize ""Oh yeah! I can use the other screen!"" The first did have a buv which caused it to feeeze on occasion, but it got promptly replaced and haven't had any issues since. I appreciate LG and their willingness to not necessarily follow the trend of the bigger name phone developers.",LG,1
"I wanted to love this device. It seemed so unique, standing out against a sea of slab-style phones. Two screens won me over immediately. However, in person this phone did not impress me. The second screen is interesting, but I found myself with the second screen just sitting there waiting to be used most of the time. I liked being able to fold away the dual screen when not in use, however this just feels like admitting defeat; you spent money on the second screen, so tucking it away seems like a waste, so then you feel obligated to find used for it. I'd love to be able to open links from the main screen (facebook, email) on the dual screen, however this was not possible. I liked how texting and Facebook messenger would put your keyboard on one screen and the conversation on the other. This was one of the main reasons I bought the phone. However typing on it had less charm than I had anticipated. It doesn't match up to tactile qwerty keyboards of yesteryear and the keys, even when ergonomically split out wide closer to your thumbs, still felt like a chore. While gaming on this phone could be fun, battery dwindles quickly when both screens are in use so I'd have a charger handy. I like the dedicated google assistant button and both screens looked great. As many reviews have said before, this was an interesting idea that falls just short of being a GREAT purchase; just enough off the mark that I'll be switching back to a boring old slab until something else interesting comes along.",LG,0
"A pseudo-foldable that doesn't cost $2,000 and is still water- and dust-resistant. I call that a win. It's a different use model than the Samsung Galaxy Fold though. The Samsung is intended to give you a single double-size screen, whereas the LG G8X gives you ""dual monitors"" for running separate apps, i.e. multitasking. There is an app that allows you to run any other app across both screens, but I find that I don't use that nearly as much as just running separate apps on the two screens.
My niggles:
1. The front of the dual screen case is a mirrored fingerprint magnet nightmare... what were they thinking???
2. The notification screen is only minimally useful; a larger color screen would be more useful, but they presumably did this to hold down cost and battery life impact.
3. The little white button slide-out thingy that you have to press in order to turn on the dual screen after inserting the phone in the case is annoying AF. It's too tiny to reliably press on, and after you've enabled the dual screen, it just sticks around to interfere with any apps you are running on the main screen. Would be infinitely more useful if it were also available as a home screen icon/widget.
My hope is that since the dual screen case is technically an accessory, that LG or third parties will come out with a Gen 2, or other variants of the case that expand and refine its functionality... that G8X owners can buy separately rather than having to wait and re-buy the next generation of phone.",LG,1
Awesome phone for multitasking! Can do multiple functions at the same time with two screens. Everything about this phone is well put together. I just took my Sim card from old phone and popped it in. Within 5 mins I was up and running.,LG,1
"It is a good phone so far. There are small differences from a Samsung, so I'm still adjusting. I greatly enjoy the second screen. I can look up a recipe on one screen, while watching a video of someone making the recipe on the other.",LG,1
"The dual screen is great for multi-tasking. It is, however, limited in what it can do. For example... You can't watch Netflix full screen. But you can watch it on one screen and do something on the other. LG is quality, as usual. It's a little on the heavy side. But you can take the phone out... Separate from the dual screen case.",LG,1
"This product is NOT Universal Compatible . It is NOT available with all LTE phones/phone services. I have Boost Mobile, which is on Sprint Network. They could not send me a SIM card for LQ G8 ThinQ phone. Boost Mobile don’t support this phone.
Please check with your mobile phone carrier prior to purchasing this phone. They will tell you the truth, if this phone is compatible with your network.",LG,0
"This phone has been heaven sent. Let's address the elephant in this phone not a foldable screen. It has two screens. So yes by know means a Samsung fold. So here is where this gets interesting. I have the Samsung Galaxy Fold but I use my Lg Dual Screen a lot more and prefer my LG a lot more for a few reasons.
1. The Price $700 vs $2100
2. The build quality is much better than the fold.
3. Mult tasking is way easier with the split screen.
4. It handles everything I throw at it and never boggles down.
I would go out on a limb and recommend this phone and yes I know it's a LG phone but my honest opinion the best value and superior build quality and price point makes this the besphonce choice available today. So if you are in the market for an amazing phone and it having to burn a hold in your pocket I highly recommend that you give this phone a try. Take the leap like I did.",LG,1
"The phone comes with great features. The screen is very beautiful, the cameras are at the level of the leading phones, and I was hoping for an optical zoom camera, the dual screen is a great idea and practical, and this made the phone at an excellent price, the fingerprint on the screen works well, the sound in the phone is excellent and pure and the sound comes out from the bottom of the phone and also from the headphones answering calls Finally, I hope LG phones return to the Middle East",LG,1
"Love it, still learning about phone.. it's easy to work. Still haven't used Bixby...I prefer Google typing when I talk to type messages. Battery life is great..the finger print sensor is on front of phone and it took a few tries for me to have my fingers recognized, I had to keep adding fingerprints to the memory. Also I did get the unlocked version and all I had to do was take the phone to sprint to let them activate it for free, they provided me with sim cards that I did have to buy for a small fee. Also I would be careful when buying screen protectors, some of them cover the sensor and are too thick so it won't recognize your fingerprint. I have been getting phone updates and everything is working great. The phone came with a charger and ear buds. I would recommend!",samsung,1
"I bought this phone to gift for someone and after I recieved it. It doesn't come with a factory seal. It just have a single tape holding the box together. On the in side the box the phone have a minor scratch on the screen and the phone's battery is not 100% seem like it been use and reset. It seem like I'm a bit picky but, I spends almost 1,000 for this to be a gift for someone. i should get some thing new, not something used and return. Called the customer service and the only thing they could do is, just to return it. I will buy another one and finger cross that I get a brand new factory seal box.",samsung,0

"Excellent smartphone, great photos, top quality.",samsung,1
"Samsung's customer support is the absolute worst. Should you need to send your device in for repairs like I did, good luck on waiting. I was initially told it could take up to seven business days from the time the tablet was received at Samsung's repair facility. On the sixth business day after my device was received at their repair facility I received an email notifying me my device was received and it could take up to seven business days to repair. Then I made multiple calls to Samsung's customer service due to the conflicting information and received more conflicting information from the representatives with alot of apologies. Some reps told me they would resolve the issue and get back with me and I never heard anything back; others told me I received the wrong information from Samsung and other representatives. Each call with customer support involved the representative trying to call the repair facility, telling me they could never get in contact with the repair facility although they would leave a voicemail (as if this would provide some level of comfort). Needless to say, I am still in limbo without my device and weeks have gone by. I would strongly urge/recommend purchasing a device from Apple or some other reputable company due to the ordeal I have had to go through with Samsung's customer support. - A Very Dissatisfied Customer",samsung,0

"I took this phone out of the box, plugged it in to charge and it got soooo hot soooo quickly... I was very scared. I thought to myself..hmmm this is how fires can start... and I decided that either it was this specific phone that had an issue or it was the model of the phone and all have issues. So, I ordered the S10+ and guess what? The phone works like a charm... does not heat up at all... not when I play and not when I charge it.... so either the S10 is a bummer... or the phone that I got was a lemon... not sure.. .either way...it went back!",samsung,1
I ordered this for the snapdragon 855 processor and US warranty. Instead I realized that I had received the slower international version with the exynos processor that is even slower than the s9 processor. The model number of the phone I received is completely different from the model number on this page. The US warranty is also not honored. I found this out after setting up the phone and looking under the about phone option. I am returning this phone for sure. Don't buy it here and risk getting a inferior phone when you are paying 1000 dollars. It's really disappointing.,samsung,0

"This phone has Exynos NOT snapdragon. It is an international version and does not work with my straighttalk SIM card. First, it doesn't connect to my mobile data, I had to add an Access Point Name so that the data would work. Second, the calls will not work unless the ""wifi calling"" is on. Plus, even when turned on, the calls hang up randomly, sometimes wont even ring, and 70% of the time I try to call someone, a box shows up that says ""Not registered on network"". I also can't send pictures AT ALL, and my texts randomly won't send.",samsung,0
"Device is not a factory unlocked device as mentioned in the seller description, and contained a T-Mobile documentation/boot screen. Upon booting, I was notified that the device had been reset (it was listed as new and unactivated), and I would need to log in under the account previously used for the device. Customer service did respond within minutes to my email explaining the situation, which is a good sign, but now I have to call during my work hours to get everything straightened out. They recommended a hard reset and sent a video explaining how to do so, but nothing has worked so far. Many recent comments appear to have similar issues.",samsung,0
"BUYER BEWARE. First, unless you live in a city that has GREAT cell signal, DON'T buy this. My $100 phone had MUCH better signal. I will likely sell this one just because it's no good if you need a cellphone.
Second: The phone worked well for 3 months, then part of the display stopped working. When my son called to make a warranty claim, they told him he would likely be billed for the repair and that when they (Samsung) opened the phone to repair it, it would VOID THE WARRANTY. So, therefore, Samsung themselves won't honor the warranty when their equipment is faulty?? And wouldn't you know the ""support window"" closed on 6/27, the very day I called Amazon to inquire about warranty. So, now apparently there isn't Amazon support for it either? The worst $800 purchase ever.
Update: I called Samsung, finally got to someone who encouraged me to send it in. She did say that if there was a sign of water damage the warranty would be void (we live in A VERY humid climate: great). They fixed it under warranty, as it had 3 things wrong.",samsung,0
"This review is for S10 model. My previous phone was a sam S5, so that is my comparison. I am a practical person, not much gaming or social media. My phone is my workhorse. Here is my good and bad...
Fingerprint - works 50% and you need to press hard. The pattern unlock is faster.
Curved glass - The curved glass edge of S10 was always causing me to false touch the screen. Looks nice though.
Telephoto - I looked back at my last 2 years of photos, very few portrait shots, so I will not take advantage of telephoto.
Glass back plate - seems useless to me. You need to cover it for protection, so what is the point? Just adds more weight. Same for colors- covered by case.
Screen - beautiful. And it goes right to the edge of device (no borders). A little longer than I am used to... the side keys are high up on the device... so stretch your fingers.
WiFi calling - not supported on this unlocked model. You need a carrier branded version in usa.
Performance. Its fast! The North America version contains the newest qualcomm 855 cpu.
Camera - not used enough yet to comment.
I think I am leaning to swap this out for the s10e version.",samsung,0
"It has been a month since I purchase this phone. While purchasing this S10, I was a bit skeptic because it is an unlocked phone. I doubted whether it will be genuine US version or not. I recieved this phone in 2 days from amazon prime shipping, kudos to its fast shipping. After I recieved, I checked this phone and it has Snapdragon and it was registered in Samsung as an unlocked phone :). I have been using this phone for a month and based on my experience here are some pros and cons of S10.
Pros
- Huge 6.1 inch display and bezel less, you will love its display.
-Its has a slim design (7.8mm) and feels almost no weight (157gm) when you hold it. I love this slim design.
-Camera quality is quite good compare to its previous version, 3 cameras at back and one at front. Camera has been really improved in S10 but still lacks behind Pixel.
- I love this blue filter mode, and it has automatic light adjustment according to your environment. If its day, brightness automatically goes high and viceversa.
- It is Snapgradon buit and has 8GB RAM so it has a quite a good speed and huge128 GB storage.
- I love this device function of split screen, you can use two app at a same time in a single screen (as shown in image).
-Accurate and fast finger print scanner and face scanner.
Cons
-Battery lasts just for a day or less. I am a average user, I use phone frequently but doesn't use heavily. Still it last for about a day or sometimes less. I need to charge this phone once in a day.
- Yes, this phone has finger print scanner, but with this function I am not able to get a strong finger print compatible screen protector.
Overall, this is a great phone for its price. But it would be an icing on a cake, if it had a longlasting battery.",samsung,1
"I ordered the prismatic black, but I got a flat black, so I feel scammed on that count. I've had it a couple of weeks so far and am generally really happy with it, a big improvement over the GS7, and I've enjoyed that phone a lot. It's faster, the battery life is amazing, the screen is beautifully crisp. The fingerprint unlock isn't perfect but it's a vast improvement. The old one wouldn't recognize me half the time. Things I don't like: when the screen is off, it's hard to tell the top from the bottom. I need to tap on the screen to wake up the fingerprint reader. I don't like that notices don't just show up on top bar; they also pop up in miniature over any other screen I'm on - articles I'm reading, games I'm playing, anything. I can drag the notice to the top of the screen to dismiss it, but it's annoying. The thing I HATE: frikken Bixby!! I would have been interested in exploring it until I realized that they set the phone up to force you into using it. You know that awesome and so very cool voice control for declining a call? While the phone is ringing, you just say, ""Reject"" and it hangs up. How sweet was that? Well, it's gone! Whoever made that decision should be fired. Now the only way to use voice commands like that is to go thru Bixby, so first you have wake up that jerk - Hey, Bixby - and THEN you can tell it to decline the call. Which means it's faster to just reach over and push the button. Totally lost the cool factor, too. I would have bought a GS9 to have kept this function. So I refuse to strong armed into using Bixby, esp since it's no faster than Google Assistant and doesn't seem to do anything the Assistant doesn't do already. I hope they rethink this good and fix it in a future update. Then this thing will be stellar!",samsung,1
"This is the second review I've made. Along with receiving my phone a week after it was expected, it came straight from the box with chinks in the screen and the screen is so fragile that almost every day a new dent shows up in the screen from just sitting in my pocket (with a case) I don't move around too much. I have an office job so there's no reason for the screen to dent so much",samsung,0
"The worst purchase on amazon ever... First, the phone box was a bit damaged. Second, fingerprint worked slow. Third, geolocation didn't work correctly. The phone couldn't recognise my timezone!!! Next, I tried to test phone and I realised that phone couldn't work with other languages! But damn, it is a Samsung s10, it should work perfect!
And the worst thing is: I bought phone as a part of lighting deal which included Phone, Galaxy Buds and Gift Card $50. And when I tried to return all items, Amazon said that I can't return Gift Card and they can refund me full price minus $50. I contacted with Customer Service and first specialist said that it is not a problem, they can just deactivate card and return me full price, since it was a part of the deal. However, second specialist said that Amazon can't do that and that first specialist was wrong... Honestly, I didn't expect such a trick from Amazon. Very disappointed.

"Description above says that the phone being sold is SM-G973UZKAXAA. However, the phone that was sent to me was SM-G973U1ZKAX. While the numbers are similar, they are definitely not the same phone.

Amazon customer service is promptly sending me a replacement. I give 2 stars because I have yet to be able to use the phone. If the replacement proves to be the correct model and does everything it's supposed to, I will edit this review accordingly.
One thing that I can say for certain is that the fingerprint scanner is greatly improved. When Samsung says that it is 1-touch scanning, it means one touch. Flat and simple!",samsung,0
"I was a little skeptical ordering an unlocked phone. I had the S7 and had never gotten an unlocked phone before. Plus, some of the reviews I saw made me skeptical. However, i am very pleased with my purchase. The S10 works flawlessly. I am not using the face recognition so i can't comment on it. The fingerprint scanner works great for me. Yeah, i sometimes have to try my fingerprint twice but it honestly doesn't bother me. The camera is superb. I went and got the otterbox defender case for it and i would always recommend getting a case for your smartphone. Switching from my AT&T S7 to this unlocked S10 was as simple as inserting my sim card into the new phone. All in all, i'm very pleased with this phone",samsung,1
"I got the Galaxy S10 since my wife has the S9 Plus and my son the S10e. I like the display a lot including the color, brightness, and especially the coverage as almost the entire phone is just an active screen.

There is a second lens on the S10 plus but it's my understanding that this additional lens is just a depth sensor. I don't take that many selfies so the approx 3x larger cut out was not worth it. The screen on the plus is also just a bit larger (same number of pixels as the S10).
Bixby is annoying. On this phone when you swipe to the left you get Bixby. On most Android phones when you swipe to the left you get a screen of apps. On my old phone I used a left swipe to get to entertainment apps and a right swap to get the productivity apps. With Samsung phones (not just the S10) I have to put all apps to the right. So to get to the entertainment apps I now have to swipe twice to the entertainment apps. It's not a terrible issue but still annoying.
The MAJOR issue I have with this phone is the in-display fingerprint reader. First of all the location is kind of awkward. When you hold the phone the natural position of your thumb is around the center of the screen but the sensor is at the bottom of the phone (this is not specific to Samsung). Much worse, if you don't put your thumb exactly where the sensor is it won't recognize it. They are supposedly working on fingerprint sensors that work over the whole display which will improve this issue but for the S10(plus) you have to be very accurate where you place your thumb. Not only that, even if you place your thumb at the right position, it still takes about 1.5 seconds for the phone to unlock. All my previous phones including Chinese brands like ZTE and Honor/Huawei had the sensor on the back. You didn't have to think where to place your finger, your finger was just at the right place when picking up the phone. In addition, the phones unlocked a lot faster than the Samsung. My wife's S9 plus has a sensor in the back which is a LOT better than the in-display sensor of my S10. My son's S10e has the sensor build into a button on the right side of the phone. It's not quite as good as having a dedicated sensor in the back but still a lot better than my in-display sensor. The only drawback of the S10e is that the screen doesn't cover quite as much as on the S10 and the screen is still a bit smaller than the S10. I wish Samsung would have used the same S10e fingerprint sensor on the S10.",samsung,1
"Got this phone brand new for Prime Day for a steal. This phone is phenomenal and it kept the headphone jack. Honestly one of the best devices out there.
The only thing holding it back is the fingerprint reader. It is a nice new technology, but I think it hinders the phone in many ways. First you can't get a regular screen protector, which I think is absolutely necessary for this device. The edge screen already makes it fragile, and not being able to use a tempered glass screen protector adds unnecessary risk. I think the S10e had the right idea by adding it to the side, and I think these phones should have followed suit. Don't get me wrong, it's cool, but it's completely unnecessary.
That's the only negative actually. This phone is beautiful in every way. Despite the fingerprint scanner, it is my favorite phone. I've recently tried the iPhone 11, and XS, but this phone is the phone to beat. Those are nice, but this phone is the most complete package you could ask for.
Camera is unbelievable! There versatility is amazing. Yes, I know the iPhone 11 pro also has these cameras, but this phone was rocking them a few months prior and was a fraction of the price on prime day.",samsung,1
This was not factory sealed and was not unlocked by Samsung. There was a piece of shipping tape used to keep the box together.,samsung,0
"Just like many other orders, I received the wrong model number.
I purchased the advertised model: SM-G973UZKAXAA, but was sent: SM-G973U1ZKAX.
Just like the other reviewers stated, even though the models seem similar they are in fact different. The advertised version is a US version which comes with a 12 month warranty by Samsung as well as contain the Snapdragon Chip.
The one that I was sent doesn't come with warranty and has an inferior processor.
I was privy to the reviews - as I trusted the 4.5 star rating system without reading the reviews first... A big mistake!
Amazon should check the bar code before sending the wrong order to this many people.
I am currently awaiting a replacement, since I did want an S10 as my primary phone.",samsung,0
It doesn't have dual sim support like my previous s9. Don't know what I'm going to do now.,samsung,0
Received open box. The phone was not sealed and the items were scattered around the box. Screen was in spanish when turned on. Do not think it is the US Version.,samsung,0
received open box. Really dissapointed,samsung,0
"What can I say that hasn't already been said about the phone. It's a top tier phone with the best screen on the market. The cameras take amazing pictures and the three lenses with their apertures give you a lot of flexibility in photo taking.
The battery easily lasts a day so most people should be fine unless they're heavy power users. But even for those folks, the phone does charge up really quickly.
I also love the speakers on the phone. The two channel sound with Adobe Atmos sound really create the illusion of surround sound (within reason. This is a phone after all.)
I picked up the phone during prime day when they were selling them at a $300 discount so for that price, the phone was a no brainer for me. Upgrading from a Galaxy S7, this was a nice leap for me.
I don't know if I would recommend the phone at $900 but that's mostly on principle. I don't believe any phone should cost as much as a midrange laptop. So, if you can pick this phone for a reasonable price, I would highly recommend it.",samsung,1
"So far, I am loving this. I've used it for five days. It was easier to switch to an unlocked phone than I expected. I love the face recognition method of unlocking your phone. You just look at the phone and swipe. So much easier than constantly having to enter your pin every time the screen goes dark. I also love the crispness of the display. Since I'm getting older, my eyes can use the assist. My last phone was a galaxy 7. When I got this one on Cyber Monday, my husband claimed the G7. I've also used it to read books. I've experimented with Bixby only a little. We will see how it goes. So far, I'm in love.",samsung,1
"This is absolutely the worst phone I've ever bought, Samsung refused to hold up their warranty so Amazon did. I either received a faulty refurbished phone or another defective Samsung Galaxy S10 because this one is worse. Now I have to request a replacement for this one. To me Samsung is a terrible company. I do appreciate Amazons help with this problem.",samsung,0
"Works pretty well, it's not supposed to be the international vs so I'm not sure why it was automatically in Spanish and I had to switch a few things to have it revert to USA English. A few of the app folders it created were also in Spanish but were simple to rename .
The finger print scanner is a little finicky but I think it will just take some getting used to and the face scanner is annoying since it's 50/50 if I'm wearing glasses or contacts but I was pleasantly surprised that it still works.
The camera and resolution is absolutely fantastic. And I love the one handed option in Samsung products since I hate how big phones have gotten making it hard for me to use with my small girl hands .",samsung,1
"Edit: Ending up returning because we could not get a signal at our house. Never had a problem with the old phone. Called AT&T and they could not figure out how to fix the problem. Also, these unlocked phones do not allow WiFi calling with AT&T. Decided to return and purchase directly from AT&T and ended up getting two phones for the price of this with their BOGO + gift card offer.
Was hesitant to order this on prime day due to all the reviews that said it is not a Snapdragon version but decided to take the chance. I received an unlocked, Snapdragon Samsung S10, confirmed with Geekbench and CPU-Z. Popped in an AT&T SIM card from old phone and good to go! Husband loves his upgraded phone. He loves the face recognition and the battery life. Overall, happy I decided to take the chance!",samsung,1
"Great screen, good battery life, everything just works. LOVE the 3 forward facing cameras. I haven't tried out the fingerprint reader or face recognition yet. I can definitely tell the processor is beefed up from my old phone: certain games used to make my old phone hot (it even had to shut down a couple times). This phone handles the games easily.
The only nits: I liked having the physical button for ""home"". I understand why they did away with it (real estate) but I still miss it. Also, the newest version of Android doesn't appear to support ""frameless"" icons. I missed the feature so I found an app which would restore it.
Extremely minor nits. I'd buy the phone again in a heartbeat.
Initial setup: I switched over from an older Samsung phone. Plopped the storage card and SIM into the new phone.
Hooked up the cable to transfer data from my own phone (comes with the phone). Followed very nice transfer and setup wizards. In about 30 minutes total I was up and running with all my old apps and data.",samsung,1
"AWFUL! So counter-intuitive! No physical ""Home"" button; the ""virtual"" home button does not even appear most of the time when you need it. Voice-to-text accuracy is even WORSE than on the S6 I traded in, none of the Apps or settings transferred properly.... it just goes on and on with BAD FUNCTIONALITY all the way around! No spell-check, STUPID swipe-to-answer setup (Why not just TAP THE BUTTON??) On and on with the worst, backward functionality :(
The S10 is a bad joke played on consumers including me! :(",samsung,0
"The one star reviews had me a bit worried, but i'm glad they didn't sway me away from purchasing the phone.
Here's a few things:
1. It is unlocked
2. If in the USA, you might not be able to simply swap in a sim card from an old phone and have it work right away. You'll need to contact your carrier and they'll set it up for you. Metro PCS charged about $16 for this.
3. The phone met the descriptions.
4. It works great and has no problems.
Scammers will sometimes order things from amazon and then swap out the item with something else that weighs the same, like replacing items with clay or dirt or rocks, and send it back to Amazon. I think there's some cases where these items appear to have never been opened and get put back into stock only to find it's way to someones home who then has most of these 1 star issues.
As for the product itself, it's very nice. Personally, I use an S7 and don't plan on upgrading for at least two or three more years. The s10 is great with it's full faced screen even though there's a dot where the camera is. Get a case. Get a good case. People complain about the screen breaking but if you mishandle your phone it can break like any other phone. Nobody in their right mind would walk around with a $650 device that will break when dropped at waist level if unprotected. Wrap it up. The screen comes with a protector already installed, but do get a case for it that adds protection.
You can use a usbc to hdmi cable to connect your phone to different devices. Samsung Dex comes with the phone so you can use it like a portable computer if you want or use screen mirroring via cable. You can also cast your screen to other devices if those devices allow for it (roku/chromecast/etc).
The camera is nice, the selfie side does leave a bit to be desired though. Good thing im not narcissistic, i'd rather take photos of my feet.
I'd buy this phone for myself if I had an older phone like a galaxy s4-s5.",samsung,1
"I have been using this phone for a month after upgrading from a Asus Zenfone 3 and I love it. Also has a headphone jack, so thumbs up to Samsung.
I do just about everything on this phone and it handles it no problem. The 8GB of RAM is more than enough to run multiple apps all at once. I usually have my music player, Google Maps with sat view, Youtube, Amazon Prime video, a game and multiple browser tabs on Chrome and the performance doesn't dip at all.
The battery life lasts me all day long, and sometimes two days with moderate usage (no games or videos) on an 80% charge. The fast charge saves me a lot of time, being able to go from 10% to 80% in about an hour or so but you may have different results because all batteries are different.
The screen is beautiful, colors are amazing, sharpness is crisp and the responsiveness is snappy. There isn't much else to say there. Camera is just as great but that is to be expected from a $900 flagship.
Speaker were surprisingly loud and clear without any hint of distortion, AND comes out of the top and bottom speakers. However, the default sound quality for music is flat and I would advise that you turn on Dolby Atmos immediately and tweak the equalizer.
_________________________
A few complaints that I have echo other people in that the fingerprint sensor leaves a lot of be desired. Sometimes it reads my finger instantly, sometimes I have to play with it a bit, sometimes it fails to read it altogether and I have to enter in the code. Placement of the sensor is located at the bottom of the screen which is not ideal in my opinion. I'd much rather have it on the back.
The Bixby button is also occasionally a pain in the ass. I keep my phone in my pocket a lot and if I accidentally press the button while trying to adjust the volume, I have to pull it out of my pocket to exit out of Bixby because it would stop my music from playing. A great feature that they added made it so that you can remap the Bixby button to open with a long press or double press but I just remapped it to open my music player instead so that my music will keep playing.",samsung,1
"Very well designed product. Camera works great and all software very responsive. Samsung Pay with MST is another great feature. Allows using phone pay with traditional credit card readers without NFC by simulating a magnetic card swipe. Does not work with recessed card readers like the ones at the gas stations though.
Battery life is not great but adequate. Will last through the day with normal use of GPS, browser and talk. Only slight issue is the fingerprint reader is not as sensitive as a dedicated fingerprint reader and requires a harder press on the screen. Bought a second unit for myself after buying the first one for my wife.",samsung,1
"Overall I really like the phone so far. This was a switch from the S6. It really is not much bigger than the S6, though I would like it a little smaller. Looking forward to discovering the new features. The shipping of the item on the other hand...
I live overseas and ordered this phone because it is unlocked and I want to use it here and in the States. Typically I experience items that are overprotected with form or shipping air bubbles, but this was in a box with other items and had zero protective packing. The primary box arrived to the post office damaged. The other items in the box were fine and not in need of special packing. The phone was in the box and in a sealed plastic bag. I opened the bag and it appeared the phone had been moved slightly. I did not want to hassle with a replacement because the device appears to have no issues and I was not sure if I would have any better luck with a replacement. The replacement process was also a hassle, in that I was required to pay for the shipping. We will see if I encounter any issues in the coming weeks.",samsung,1
"A wonderful product continuing the Samsung Galaxy S# lineup in its natural progression. It still has the quirks of Samsung fiddling with the phone OS to make it their own, but it is a solid top-of-the-line model phone that has a long lasting battery relative to the performance it provides and if you can find it at price that you find reasonable is a smart purchase.
I'm certainly biased towards pure-Android phones, and this iteration isn't that bad of a compromise in terms of how much Samsung has plastered on to it, considering how easy it is to disable the bloatware and install a different home manager.",samsung,1
"Samsung stated that if the phone was purchased by a certain date, the phone came with a set of wireless earbuds. While I like the phone, I am upset that the advertised ""free"" item was ignored. The moral of the story - Amazon may not fulfill what was advertized; or, if you pay for something with points, they take their time and accept the order until later. Had I known this, I would not have rushed to buy it. Had I not have had this problem, I would have given it another star. By the way, it does not come with an S stylus like previous phones and tablets.",samsung,0
"AT&T wanted $899 for this phone, With the $200 off sale price plus Amazon Prime day special I got it for $599
Nothing negative towards seller at all. I love this phone, but I won't marry it. O_o
AT&T on the other lets you BYOD. But nowhere in their policy does it say that your unlocked phone wont have all the features of the AT&T branded S10. I lost Video calling (never used it) Wifi Calling, (Also never used it) and Call protection which I did use. After 4 unsuccessful results wit my calls to ATT Customer service, I visited an ATT Store, where a rep there told me the above information. Why didn't their Customer service know this?",samsung,1
"I was skeptical about upgrading my S9 to an S10, but frankly...it was worth it. A small crack in the screen of my S9 ended up pushing me over the edge, and (in hindsight) I'm glad. You're paying for some gimmicky features to be sure (power-sharing and the wide-angle lens to name a couple), but the overall build-quality, improved camera software, and streamlined Android Pie skin alone make the S10 worth the price.
To be clear, I love this phone. But here are some of the downsides, for those of you who (like me) look for the worst-case scenario in order to determine whether or not they could live with those flaws:
(1) The fingerprint reader. I'm not really sure what was so dysfunctional or invasive about the rear-facing capacitive finger-print scanner, but the in-screen sensor just doesn't work 100% of the time. I've gotten better at finding the correct spot with my finger over the last month, but I would say that I still miss about 1/5 times...which can be annoying. Thankfully, the face unlock is pretty smooth for those of you who are comfortable with a less secure form of screen-unlocking. That said, if you want to use the fingerprint unlock even a little bit, you really can't have a *reasonably priced* tempered glass screen protector on your phone, which sucks.
(2) The punch out is...not ideal. Having used an iPhone X for a while, I can say definitively that it's better than the notch. But with the improved durability of the mechanically retracting front-facing camera units, and the admittedly problematic emergence of under-screen cameras, it just seems like the hole-punch is a bit of a gap-filler for people who are desperate for more screen real-estate. I can't say that I forget about the hole-punch completely, but it also isn't obtrusive or offensive to me at this point. It's just part of the experience.
(3) Bixby. Even though you can now re-map the Bixby button, no matter what you do there will always be a certain kind of press (double-press, single-press, or press and hold) that brings up some form of Bixby. It's kind of like when you're walking past sidewalk canvassers that are raising money for a cause that you definitely believe in: You can appreciate that the intent was pure, and you may even like what they have to offer. But you want to give them your time on your own terms, and when the pushier they get, the less interested you become...I may be getting lost in my metaphor, but you get what I'm trying to say.
And that's it. Those are literally the only problems I've had. The cameras are great, the live focus mode is better than (in some cases) even iPhone X portrait mode, the response time and processing power are top-notch, and the screen is just unbelievable. Hope this helps you in your quest to find a new mechanical device to which you will inevitably devote half of your day, reveal all of your personal information, and possibly sell your soul.",samsung,1
"Preface: I only ever owned iPhones up until I bought this phone, so my review will be based on how well the phone is and how user friendly the operating system is compared to iOS.
Pros:
Lightweight, slim, good camera, phenomenal battery life, screen protector installed
Cons:
Slow fingerprint reader, can't access certain settings in lockscreen, finding a decent case
The phone is slim and lightweight that I barely feel it in my hand. For some it might be a con but for me that's a pro. Further a decent case can give it a nice weight.
The camera is nicer than I expected but to be fair I'm not one to obsess about phone cameras.
The battery life last quite a while especially if you go to the settings and change the battery power settings to optimized or medium power saving mode. Typically for me it last up to 8 hours while I either play music, text and browse the internet. At work with music only it lasts far longer.
Last, a screen protector comes preinstalled. It's a nice touch and it means I didn't have to buy one. However, the screen protector is on the flimsy-er side. It gets easily scratched. After a week with nothing in my pocket but my phone, the screen protector got small scratches. Cannot really complain since it was free but still just letting people know.
Moving on to the cons, the fingerprint reader is slower than expected. I have tried putting my fingerprints multiple times but it does not compare well to iPhones. Mind you, the difference is about a second or so but my old iPhone SE could read my fingerprints faster.
Some cases for this phone are flimsy and won't provide the protection needed so it's best to find a youtube video. I found a video, about 30 minutes long, with the person doing a quick review of like 30 cases, around a minute or so per case. He showed the case, placed it on the phone, dropped the phone with he case on it to see if it would protect the phone, and checked to see if wireless charging would work.
Further, the reviews on some of the cases are so bizarre as some don't even seem to belong to the item the person is talking about. Also, there were multiple times that I searched for Samsung Galaxy S10 phone case, clicked on a case I found intriguing, just for it to be only for an S10+ or S10e. And I know to check under the product for the tab that allows you to change the style and sometimes even for what phone you want. Many of the ones I picked did not have this option
Now onto the operating system. Some settings I was used to having on IOS are not found on android. For instance, the music player on the lock screen is not well placed or has a way to skip certain parts of a song. Also, if I want to quick respond to a text, I have to unlock the phone and respond from the app. If I want to turn on or turn off the wifi or data, again I have to unlock the phone even if I use the pull down menu in the lock screen.
On the other hand, android has made changes that have made the operating system user friendly for someone changing from iOS. For instance, you can choose to hide apps the way android traditionally handled apps or you can have them across multiple pages on the homescreen reminiscent of iOS.
Overall though, by downloading some apps and changing certain settings, I was able to easily adapt to the phone. By the end of the first week, I could not go back to my old phone.",samsung,1

"This S10 phone is faster than the previous models. The camera is better, the battery life is better and like the fact that it comes with screen protector already installed from factory. Though, I compared the physical size of the S10 with that of the S8 and it turns out that it is identical with the only exceptions of button layout, front screen layout and rear camera layout. The proximity sensor was great in previous models, not sure why they decided to eliminate it on this S10.

Great phone overall but while they added the camera features they put the bio-metric scanner on the front of the phone.

"Even though I rather Microsoft's Windows phone( that Microsoft is not making anymore at least for now), this phone is IMPECCABLE with great features... in fact there are so many great features that I have yet to learn...",samsung,1
"First of all, this was my first ""unlocked"" phone experience. It was a little scary buying a phone outside of my cell provider. But moving my SIM card from the old phone to this one was a breeze. After I logged into my provider account, I saw that that new phone model and serial # was updated. Next, purchasing the newest Galaxy was an easy choice! Been a longtime Samsung Galaxy user. I did not realize the camera upgrades were so awesome! I have been tempted to go to the iPhone due to the camera. But no need now! This phone is AMAZING!",samsung,1
"First phone received would not work with my service provider, apparently because phone was built for South America. Amazon promptly replaced it with one that worked perfectly. Much improved battery from S7. Quite a few changes to learn in camera, contacts, phone. In spite of my learning problems as a 91 year old, the machine is a 5 star.",samsung,1
Have had this phone for a few months now and I love everything about it. All the scanners work well and it works with sprint!,samsung,1
I received the wrong item and I was not even compensated after sending back the wrong item. Now using a family members phone.,samsung,0
"The S9 is much better than the Galaxy S10 on the design of the phone. The phone looks very similar to the S9. However, the fingerprint inside of the front display is a pain in the ass. The front camera inside the display is a problem too. Usually, the fingerprint doesn’t recognize anything. I run the setup with multiple fingers and same problem. The only improve over S9 is the battery life and some camera modes. In general, it's really a very bad design.",samsung,0
very good,samsung,1
"Bought this on lightning deal, with earbuds(which were never delivered) , Came into original case but without seal, felt like it was opened by someone earlier. camera is average, too many camera options ruined the ease of taking photos.",samsung,0
"Install GCAM, much better for people / portrait photos.",samsung,1
Great phone but this phone is the inernational model and does not work with Metro by T-Mobile,samsung,0
"Upgraded from the s7 edge and this phone is amazing. The phone is crazy fast, the screen is sharp, battery life is great, the fingerprint scanner is really good too oh and the camera is also very good. Haven't had much time to check everything this phone has to offer yet since I just got it but I don't regret the purchase nor the price tag!",samsung,1
I like this phone a lot. The battery life is great. The cameras are awesome. Best phone of the year!,samsung,1
"My dad is very excited about his new phone.
For the past few days he is updating and learning the new phone.
My dad is 78 and he said it is very easy to use.",samsung,1
"Don't use the face recognition...
The battery life is fantastic compared to our old Galaxy S6!
The screen sensitivity needs work/adjusting.",samsung,1
I had a Galaxy 9 and noticed a real improvement in software and image on this Galaxy 10. Probably the biggest jump between Galaxies. This is my 5th.,samsung,1
Took a few days to get used to the controls but it is a very nice and 3asy to use phone. Great pictures and very versitile. Saved $500 buying it one prime days over buyi g it from either the carrier or Best Buys. Thank you Amazon.,samsung,1
Great phone I bought it unlocked I had hoped to use my same AT&T carrier it did not work with them no matter what switched and bundled to Comcast saved a car load of money excellent phone,samsung,1
Unlocked. As advertised. Box was dented but everything else was okay. Phone works perfectly. Arrived fast. Easy to transfer data using smart switch. Went from s6 to this s10. Deal was awesome through Amazon. 100 bucks off for the black one. It's a gorgeous phone and the display is the best. Sleek and smooth. Camera is amazing and I love it. No complaints at all. Will update if there are any changes. Minor scuff mark on the screen protector but not a problem.,samsung,1
I love it! Decided to get this in amazon credit card so my phone bill doesnt increase by $32. Best choice I've ever made! It was time to upgrade from my Galaxy S8.,samsung,1

"I'm from Belarus and bought cellphone while I was in USA. When I came home from vocation I realized that this cellphone is locked and I can't use it until I get Verizon code to unlock it. But nor Samsung nor Verizon didn't provide me this code as according to cellphone IMEI number it was locked.
Unfortunately celler couldn't help me and only Amazon took responsibility and provide the refund.",samsung,0
"Nice phone, fingerprint sensor is not as fast or accurate as physical ones but okay, screen is amazing. Camera is also the best among the phones ever used",samsung,1
"Pretty much what you would expect out of a 2019 flagship. Fingerprint sensor is a bit tedious to use with screen guard, we had to change 3 screen guards to get it to work and even then it’s dicy. Face recognition obviously is not as secure as you would want it to be. Phone other wise is at the top of 2019 specs and screen size is good too.",samsung,0
"The look and feel of the phone are amazing. Sleek model!! But for the cons, battery life is not as expected if we use the camera and apps. So far the options that came with this model are good. The fingerprint reader is not as expected since it is inbuilt.",samsung,1
"I really loved the adaptor included. It lets you pass all your information and data from your older samsung to your new one! It's weird because when I first used my s10 it felt like I was using my s7 edge but with more power!!! Nice holding, nice size and thickness, I don't know, so far it's been a super good purchase! LOVE IT!",samsung,1
"I love the quality of pictures & videos the S10 takes. The finger print reader doesn't work everytime, which gets annoying. But It's super easy to transfer your data from an old galaxy to the current. 9/10 Buying one for the hubby when black Friday sales comes around.",samsung,1
"Great phone overall, only complaint is the camera being SUPER zoomed in.",samsung,1
Me myself loved everything about the s10. To me the best of all. I have the s8 and it is still a great phone. Didn't think the s10 wouldn't be enough to upgrade from s8 to s10 but I was wrong. I returned it because my Dad passed on 7- 29- 19 and he was my income and I couldn't afford it. Hopefully in the near future I will be able to purchase it again. So I think the s10 is so worth it.,samsung,1
"The only positive thing I saw is good battery life but every time the phone updates a new software the wall paper changes without my knowledge. It changes by itself.

I have had no issue except I accidentally raised the pre Installed screen protector. Now i have bubbles.,samsung,1

"This is my first android phone, and I happy with this phone",samsung,1
Bought this phone as a replacement for my S7. It has way more features than I'll ever use but that is why I like Samsungs over Apple products. Battery life lasts forever. It was worth it.,samsung,1
Works great as a phone but very delicate. Phones screen developed a crack in my pocket. Would not recommend unless you have the phone in a bulky otter box the entire time.,samsung,1

"I can’t believe how horrible the fingerprint scanner is on this thing. During setup I had to push way too hard on the screen for it to register my fingerprint, and once set up it failed to recognize my fingerprint more than 50% of the time. I tried different fingers and tried re-registering them twice. Even tried a factory reset. Huge disappointment, had to return it. Getting the Note 9 instead since it’s $350 off.",samsung,0
"This is NOT the American version of the phone. This is the Europe Version. Which has different processors and is cheaper. The Europe version also doesn't come with an American warranty. Check the model number and google it make sure you received the correct model.
The American version and International version of the phone are both great phones. I don't like being charged for a more expensive phone and getting a cheaper one. I think it's extremely misleading.",samsung,0
"I travel all over the US and Europe and this phone works great. Sleek form, fit, and function-- A+. I purchased an armband for running/working out and the phone has had zero issues. Important note to all purchasing, the phone 'comes with a pre-installed screen protector' which is solid. My wife has long acrylic fingernails and was unable to peel it from the screen. Overall I'm satisfied with the phone upgrade (upgraded from an S7 Edge). My only issue is all my previous charging cables for the S7 are null, as the S10 has a different charging port requiring me to purchase new charging cables.",samsung,1
"Loveeee the phone. It's amazing without a doubt.
I really thought the S10 would be fine for my hand size....guess time to go for the +",samsung,1
"I upgraded from S9+ to S10. In general it is great smart phone. One of the great feature that the processor is super fast with downloading or surfing the web and very stable. However I have the following downsides on the S10: 1. The finger print recognision is not as easy or smooth to unlock the devise, S9 finger print is faster and more accurate. 2. Battery life in S9+ does last longer than the S10.",samsung,1
"My last phone was a Samsung On5 so it is taking me time to adjust and evaluate it. Some of the things are equally aggravating like touch control, not working when you want it to and sensitive when not wanting it to (and yes I know there is a touch control).
I HATE when products change things like icons, widgets, avatars or whatever new name they can assign them. Not only the picture, but color and even actions they designate. If they find the NEED for a change at least give me the option of keeping the old look so I don't have to spend needless time finding things. This applies to most computerized tech hardware and software. I am most reluctant to get new stuff because of this. I didn't buy a new phone for these silly changes. I bought a new phone for better storage, larger screen, better camera, voice recorder etc. Instead it appears I have to go to an app store to get one that came with a much cheaper phone. So larger memory is not as large as claimed. I spend half the time trying to figure out how to navigate the new product. This does NOT make me want to buy the next model. Sorry I have better things to do with my lifetime. For these reasons I am giving it only 3 stars.",samsung,1
Finally got an update to my wife's phone. She has been through 2 replacement batteries in the Note 4 and the screen was burned. It still worked but was getting pretty sluggish. She will only use Samsung and had planned on getting another Note but the Prime Day deal on the S10 was too good to pass up. She absolutely loves the phone! She takes a lot of pictures and the camera upgrade has been the best part of the upgrade. With a 256GB card she has plenty of space for all the photos she can take. The S10 has a data & app migration app that made it simple to move just what she wanted from the Note to the S10. She was even able to keep texts (which I assumed she would lose). A trip to a local AT&T store for a new SIM card and everything worked right off! Very pleased with this phone.,samsung,1
"Some will read this review and say, ""Okay, Boomer"", and that's fine since it fits me perfectly. I upgraded from an S6 to an S10, just because. The S6 was fine. The S10 is better. Most everything migrated fine from one phone to the other, using Samsung's app. A few things in ""Contacts"" didn't transfer, nor did a few things in ""Calendar"". Interestingly, birthdays made it to the new calendar, but appointments, vacations, concerts, etc., didn't. For those of us at a certain age, familiarity is nice. The S10 will allow you to make your home page and other app pages look like your old S series phone, which was a great comfort to me. The phone was advertised as having a much better battery - maybe not so much. It holds a charge for about a day, just like my old phone. It has a bunch of helpful settings the S6 didn't, and they were easy to understand and setup, even for the technology-challenged, like me. There was one amazing glitch, which has since been resolved. Crazy as it sounds, I could not answer an incoming call. Pressing the green phone button didn't work. Using the volume button didn't work (per Samsung's suggestion). Finally, while on an online chat with Samsung, a system upgrade downloaded. Guess what? I can now answer my phone - not with a ""press"", but a swipe (although a swipe didn't work b4 upgrade). Anyway, I like the new phone. It wasn't a necessity, and I can't call anyone I couldn't call with the old phone, but I enjoy it. I think you will, too.",samsung,1

"Had been looking at this phone for a while but refused to pay the going price, then got a deal from Amazon when they had their Prime days. It's a really nice phone, replaced my LG V20 which is still a good phone but the Samsung is noticeably faster. I still prefer the size of my LG, wish now I had gotten the S10+ but I can live with this one. I always buy factory unlocked so I can use whatever SIM I want and no contracts. Currently using a Tracfone SIM in this one.",samsung,1
"I absolutely love the Galaxy S10! Only thing I wished was that it had a 5000 mah battery because battery life is okay. It's not bad but definitely could be improved. Power users will want to carry a external battery with them in order to use this phone at maximum potential ie having the screen bright, keeping it running at high performance without using power saving functions. Plus it comes with a screen protector. It's not the best one but I love that it came with one.",samsung,1
"I just got my phone yesterday so I'm just getting used to it. So far it is great. I love the camera. How fast it is. But the home ""button and back button "" aren't really buttons they are right under the keyboard so I end up hitting them all the time. Only drawback so far",samsung,1
"This is an excellent phone with a great screen and a headphone jack (the two things I care the most about). Coming from an S8, usage of this phone is familiar, though I'll admit that I preferred the finger print reader I had before (this one takes more tries to unlock). Overall, it's a pretty big step up, and a phone that I plan to hold onto for years (largely thanks to the disappearance of headphone jacks on flagship phones). Couldn't be happier with my choice of a phone.",samsung,1
"I hate the curved screen. There is color shift around the edge, and the screen is always registering touches from just holding the phone. Otherwise the phone is fine, but too thin to hold without a case. I like the speed of the S10 over the S7, but the form factor of the S7 better. I liked the removable battery in the S5.",samsung,0
Confirmed directly with Samsung that I received a US version phone. Popped our Tmobile sim chip in and worked right away. Great screen. Great camera,samsung,1

Just be sure that you know what you are buying. This is the international version of the phone which is a tiny bit slower than the US version which has a better processor in it. ( both phones are incredibly good though).",samsung,1

"Its a good phone. Not great but good. Going from the S7 to the S10 was quite change since the front physical button went away. I love the full screen but definitely miss my button. The fingerprint detector normally takes me a few times before it unlocks which is the only main frustration in my book. The second minor grump is sometimes when it is unlocked the screen looks as if its still locked so I continue to touch it before I notice that it is actually open and you just need to swipe to make it look open. Maybe they could change the blur to the app icons immediately when the fingerprint works?
The speaker is a huge improvement. Music and phone calls sound even more clear than with the S7. It also seems to have a much louder volume ability with apps such as spotify which was an issue with the S7. The camera(s) are a big improvement as well. Lots of photo options and even better pics in dim areas.
The processor speed is also noticeable. It opens apps and slides flawlessly. Very smooth operation and video is almost instant. I am pleased with the purchase and am hoping they can fix the few bugs mentioned before with software patches.",samsung,1
"Screen is gorgeous, phone is fast and responsive, cameras are great.
Here is the problem: the signal strength is piss poor. I never have full bars and the phone constantly drops calls and goes to roaming or no service. This apparently is a known issue (google s10 signal strength). Seriously, I can lay my phone without a case, right next to an s7 edge, both on sprint, and there is a 10% signal loss on the s10. Samsung gives me the run around. I wish I had never bought this phone. I’ll tell you this much, after using Samsung phones for over 10 years, I will never buy another one.",samsung,1
"I haven't owned a Samsung Galaxy since the S3--my last seven phones have been from Huawei or Xiaomi and before that from One Plus, Essential and Google (Nexus and Pixel). But after several years of using international unlocked phones I wanted to try an Android phone specifically meant for use in the United States again and since One Plus and Pixel phones are ludicrously overpriced Samsung ended up being pretty much the only choice.
The good:
The Galaxy S10+ features the latest generation Snapdragon 855 processor (in North America, China, and Japan--everybody else gets Samsung's inferior in-house Exynos processor instead) and plenty of RAM so it's fast and powerful.
The display is nice, both large and bright with excellent color. On paper, the display supports HDR+ allowing 4K content from Netflix to be viewed with the best color accuracy but when watching movies and television episodes on a 6.4-inch smartphone screen, I'm not sure how anyone can actually tell.
The ultrasonic fingerprint scanner and face unlock are fast (although I didn't test how secure either actually was).
The battery is large and should provide even heavy users who do lots of media streaming or gaming with a full day of power on a single charge.
Signal strength and call quality are excellent.
You even get a headphone jack and a slot for an external memory card, two features you almost never see these days on flagship smartphones. The Samsung Galaxy S10+ also runs Android Pie which is currently the latest version of Android.
The bad:
While Samsung used to have one of the best Android cameras they have fallen behind Chinese rivals Huawei and Xiaomi. The camera on the S10+ is solid and takes good enough pictures but as flagships go it doesn't measure up to the competition--particularly where low light shots are concerned. Samsung has been using the same camera sensor on its Galaxy line since the S7--that's four generations of Galaxy phones without an upgrade.
Samsung's current charging technology is almost painfully slow compared with Xiaomi and Huawei--particularly wireless charging which seems to take forever.
Bixby which was supposed to be Samsung's alternative to Google Assistant. I don't know even one person with a Samsung phone who actually uses Bixby but there's a dedicated Bixby button on the S10+. Samsung needs to either ditch the Bixby button entirely or make it easier to remap. The Xiaomi assistant button can be remapped to Google or Alexa in seconds. With Samsung you need to download a third-party app from the Play Store, have access to a computer, download ADB tools from Google or another website, enable the hidden Developer Options menu on your phone and allow USB Debugging, connect your phone to the computer, open a command prompt window and then type the necessary ADB commands--otherwise the Bixby button is always mapped to Bixby.
The Galaxy S10+ is less comfortable to hold than any phablet I've owned in recent memory--overall the size is virtually identical to the Xiaomi MI 9 but the S10+ feels awkward and the less than ergonomic button placement (power button very high on the right side with Bixby and volume buttons very high on the left) doesn't help. The Galaxy S10+ might be a little on the heavy side thanks to its large battery but a slightly more curved body and better button placement would have gone a long way towards making the S10+ more comfortable in the hand.
The speakers are loud-- the S10+ comes with a single bottom-firing speaker and a front-facing earpiece speaker that's also used to create a stereo effect--but they don't really sound very good even with Dolby Atmos to enhance the quality.
Samsung is terrible with software updates for its official US unlocked phones--right now it's August and their unlocked S10+ is still on the May security patch. In the US unlocked smartphones account for an extremely small percentage of the market so Samsung focuses their resources on software updates for carrier-branded models. Updates for Samsung's unlocked US phones come months after the carriers get them.
The rest:
The use of a punch hole in the display for the front-facing cameras (and earpiece speaker?) is something I have mixed feelings about. It does give Samsung bragging rights on paper about a higher screen to body ratio but in practical everyday use, the camera cutout is located far enough from the top of the display that you end up with an unusually thick screen-wasting taskbar when using apps not designed for fullscreen mode--and with fullscreen apps that have a light background the dark oval punchout is at least as distracting as a notch.
Samsung uses its own custom skin on top of Android called One UI. The overall software experience isn't bad and there are definitely some useful features that you won't find in stock Android. The problem is that Samsung throws in an over-abundance of features that can't be disabled even if you have no use for them so One UI ends up needlessly draining the battery. With more streamlined software S10+ owners could easily get two full days of normal use without a charge but One UI sucks up way too much power for that to happen.
Ultimately the biggest problem with the Galaxy S10+ is price--the Xiaomi MI 9 has the same Snapdragon 855 processor as the S10+, is every bit as fast, charges more quickly, takes better pictures, and offers both face-unlock and an in-screen fingerprint reader and overall build quality superior to phones from Google Pixel and OnePlus.
The Xiaomi MI 9 listed for $500 at launch but can currently be purchased for as little as $350 brand new. With the Galaxy S10+, you get a nicer display and bigger battery but is that worth an extra $400-$600?
There are two very large problems for smartphone consumers here in the United States:
1) Apple and Samsung have a virtual duopoly in the market here and account for roughly 70% of all phone sales in the United States, giving Apple and Samsung pretty much no incentive to innovate or lower prices.
2) 90% of consumers in the United States purchase phones through their carriers, giving our phone carriers the power to act as the gateway to US customers and eliminate anything resembling free-market competition.
In terms of innovation and price, the best Android phones in recent years have come from Xiaomi, Honor, and Huawei but none of those phones are on shelves here in the United States. That's allowed Samsung, Google Pixel and OnePlus to sell US consumers inferior phones at grossly inflated prices.
The Samsung Galaxy S10+ might currently be the best phone on the US market--it has significantly more premium build quality than phones from Google Pixel or Oneplus, it’s fast and powerful, has a big battery, a great display and lots of features. But in a market with better choices paying more than $700 for the Galaxy S10+ would be hard to justify.",samsung,1
"The phone is a miracle. Upgraded from an S6. Zero regrets. Most impressed with the dynamic range of the images and the phenomenal battery life.
Details that may be interest:
Some initial disappointment with the finger print reader WRT consistency. Finally I tried a third digit - middle finger (seriously). In doing the initial imprinting, I placed the distal flexion crease of the finger on the rim on the protective case and did all registration placements from that reference point. When I open with the fp reader, I place the crease on that rim of the case and just rock it forward onto the sweet spot for the ID. Works 95% on the first try.
The Armadillo Tek hefty case (which has prevented damage from several spills to the floor) happily does NOT prevent charging with the EP 3100 wireless Samsung charger. Works fine. But, charging the earbuds from the S10 thru this case does not work.
One final nit-pick. I am disappointed the S10 does not seem to offer the voice activated shutter release. I used that on the S6 and liked it.",samsung,0
"I mostly love the phone, but the Bixby button is a pain. Bixby is the samsung AI ""helper"", the button is in a place that is almost halfway on the phone. It gets bumped often and can not be turned off. Recently a tiny 21mb update would pop up at turn on and anytime the button was hit. I didn't have wifi access and it refused to update over the network until 2 weeks went by. I had to click yes or no to the update, it would tell me I needed to be over wifi, and I accepted, it let me leave screen. So the normal pain of 1 screen to back out of was 3.
On the issue of the stars for face recognition. If it was in my pocket or being held and locked it would often ""look"" for a face. It would often be hot, use the battery, only work with light, and constantly have a bright red light. It probably works great for some and bad for others",samsung,0

I constantly get SIM card not detected notifications. My phone is not functional. For the flagship phone at the highest price out there this is ridiculous. I am not happy with the purchase of this phone and wish I would've kept my S8. This thing has all of the same issues and problems. And now I am getting the SIM card not detected notification which I have never received before on any of my Galaxy devices. This phone is not worth the price.,samsung,0
"I have owned and generally enjoyed Samsung phones in the past. For various reasons--actually not and kind of brand dissatisfaction--my last phone was a Sony Experia, which, unfortunately broke. Current Sony phones do not have headphone jacks, thus eliminating them as potential phones. I looked up the best phones and the Samsung Galaxy S10e came up. My girlfriend convinced me to buy the S10 instead and I feel I have made a great mistake. The design is horrible, the curve is not superfluous, but actually irritating. I also hate that the damned thing slides off of just about any surface. The worst Samsung--correction, worst PHONE--I have ever owned and I keep asking myself why I bought it. Save yourself and get a real phone.",samsung,0
"The battery stopped holding a charge at 3 months. Verizon told me they would warranty replace the phone. The chargers port started giving me problems after a month.

"Cool phone, just don't look at the screen the wrong way or it will crack. Forget if you bump it, it'll probably just injure you.
It does alot of things, aside from staying in one piece. This phone was designed to break by samsung so that you can pay 249 for a new screen. It's a scam. Only buy it if you plan on not using it in the real world. It will break, 100%.",samsung,0

I had no trouble setting it up once I got the right size SIM card. I use AT&T so I had to go into the store & buy a new one for $5 (since I didn't get the device from AT&T).
It's been about 3 weeks, & I have had no problems with it freezing or any kind of malfunctioning. I did notice that the price went down after I purchased, but prices fluctuate on Amazon a lot so it was poor timing on my part. Still a good deal on a like-new phone in my opinion.",samsung,1
Screen cracked wasn’t even a galaxy s9 it was some other junk & bad esn,samsung,0
"It's only day one, but so far the phone arrived less than a week after ordering. Not a single scuff or scratch, and had the peelable plastic protector over the screen. I already have ATT so this phone accepted all my transfers with the Smartswitch app with no problem (after I figured to activate the sim and new IMEI number on my ATT account online then restarted the phone!!) Went through the phone and put all my setting the way I like them, all went well. Deleted or disabled bloatware and apps I'll never use. This phone did not have a bunch of apps from another phone service, so definitely ATT!
I never used wifi calling, had it turned off on my other phone. This phone is telling me unable to set up wifi calling, call some 800 number, I plan to, but not important to me since I don't plan to be in a remote area or foreign country where I need to use wifi calling. I may update later so others know if wifi calling actually works on this phone. It is a refurbished phone, I took my chances and will also update later as to if the phone crashed or sucks in any way. The seller WirelessGlobe has a good rating compare to others, so glad I went this route. He also has a 90 return policy like Amazon. And to top it off I even got the little key to open the sim/sd drawer, no sewing pin needed and the phone was fully charged! Looks like the curved tempered glass I ordered will fit fine too according to the generic case I already ordered. So far, worth the risk with this seller!
Day 2, It has asked me to do a million updates. I was about to just turn notifications off for this. But I did some reading online on att and samsung website. Seems like you have to go through several updates to get to the most recent one, which so far is June 2019. Under about phone, software info, the android 9 version should be there. Also the baseband version should match the second half of the build number. I went through maybe 6 updates to get to the June 2019, so far final update. Now Im turning off update notifcations and leaving it at that. So I think Im good, if there are more issues I will just call samsung or att. This was nerve wracking, but so far so good still!!
So the wifi calling and the updates is still concerning, but not terribly. Will update later, still have 88 days to try the phone!
It's been a month now. Wifi calling if needed is no problem. Just settings on the phone. Anyway. Phone works great, no issues whatsoever. So glad it worked out. Everything is perfect. amfilm glass screen protector for samsung s9 3d curved tempered glass dot matrix with easy installation tray by TechMatte works perfect with the phone. Thin and thick case friendly. I am very satisfied with the whole experience.
Update 3 months later. Love it, no issues. Happy it worked out for me!!
6 months later-- Love the phone, no issues. Here is a tip, Do Not get a GSM phone and expect CDMA phone to function properly and vice versa. Getting a used or referbished phone, only get one that already works on the phone service you want to use. Even if the seller says it works on all services (it will only if it is a manufacturer unlocked new phone). Learn about which services are GSM and which are CDMA. If it's not clear or the ratings are bad, move on. This seller was great.",samsung,1
"I've used just about every smartphone OS and was a long-time Blackberry user until moving to Apple around 2012. I was able to play with every smartphone OS (for work) and since Android was hit or miss back then I settled for iOS.
I decided to give Android another try with the Galaxy S9. Yes, I was also very skeptical about trying a refurbished phone but given Amazon's gracious return policy I felt it was worth the risk.
My received unit came in a plain white (smartphone) box and came with original Samsung accessories -- new charger, USB to USB-C cable, wired headphones and a USB to USB-C adapter.
The phone itself was covered in plastic. Upon removing the plastic the phone looked to be brand new. Zero scratches or dings on the screen. Perhaps a few super-fine scratches on the back but hardly noticeable.
The phone came about 80% charged and powered up with no issues. Disappointingly, the phone came with the stock Android 8.0 firmware. While connected to Wi-Fi I didn't receive any update notifications -- which was annoying. I put in my nano-SIM and again still no notifications to update. A manual update didn't work either. I started looking to flash the appropriate Android 9 image to the phone directly but after about 20 minutes I finally received a notice to update. Sadly, this was a linear process. In total, I probably did about 8 updates. A few 8.0 patches and then the large 9.0 update and then a few more 9.0 patches. It seems with Android OS you cannot just upgrade to the latest Android version. Lame.
That being said, the phone has been working great with no issues. There are some quirks about Android 9 I don't like but then again there are a lot of features to like.
Positives:
S9 is still very fast device for 2019
Gorgeous, high-resolution screen (570ppi)
Faster charging (compared to my iPhone XS Max)
Very lightweight and a slim profile
MicroSD slot
Accessories cost less. Spigen case for $13!
Can have 35 icons on a single page -- no need to swipe thru multiple pages
Android apps seemed more refined than Apple apps and usually have more features/options
Android OS can be customized to user's liking
Negatives:
A lot of useless Samsung bloatware. I don't need this crap. Fortunately, it can mostly be hidden or disabled.
The speakers are not very loud. Even at full volume it's hard to hear when driving around.
Curved screen. Just don't like it. I notice newer Samsung phones are going back to flat screen. Yay!
Sound setup in Android OS is a bit wonky. Included sounds are pretty generic and lame. Needs customization.
Camera is good but Android software is too busy; need to consolidate settings for more simpler interface; PRO mode is very nice feature

Really beautiful all around edge to edge screen that is truly superb. The picture is crisp clear and vivid. UI ""one"" 1.1 is clean and Android ""pie"" 9 smooth. Fast and precise and loaded with tweak features👍🏻 this phone is lit. My only nag is knox, i forgot about knox, i hate knox and i hope maybe somthn has changed? 🤬...i have owned S1-S6 and luved all but the S6 samsung ruined. This model is the USA unlocked for carrier but has locked bootloader so no root. There is a UK version made in Hong Kong that has the snapdragon with bootloader that can be unlocked, I'm not sure if it has a warranty or not. If u absolutely want root buy the international version with no USA warranty. This USA version is not preloaded with all the carrier and garbage apps it has a few Google but not really a big enough bother to me to want root. I'd buy a s7 or s8 maybe s9 international to root but y spend $ for a phone brand new with no warranty??",samsung,1
"I've had Samsung phones for the past 8 years. Upgraded pretty much every other version. This will be my last.
The hardware is fantastic, screen is incredible, camera is a huge upgrade, but the Samsung bloatware is now untenable. Some examples:
1. I tried to switch to Google Messages, but sent messages are lost as Samsungs stock app does not save them in the same place, to NO new message app can get to your sent messages. What does this look like when you enable Google Messages (which can work across many devices, unlike Samsung) - all you see is the stuff you received, nothing sent
2. Contacts - I tried to switch to Google contacts, but Samsungs Contacts has control and I see nothing. Didn't even bother trying to debug it
3. Removing my Samsung Account - I enabled it thinking it would help. Big mistake. I've been trying to remove it for hours. Their website says it's in the ""more"" menu, but when I bring up my more menu their is no option to remove. I gave up and just filled a complaint with the EU data privacy team - maybe they can do something.
4. Bixby - is just horrible and they constantly push it. You can enable Google assistant but there's no way to just remove Bixby and the bloatware around it.
My suggestion if you are looking at this phone is to consider the Pixel or some other phone without all the bloatware instead at this point. Samsung should do what they do best, hardware. That's why I've always liked them. It's 100% clear that Samsung engineers are incapable of developing even modestly decent software.
I did do research before I bought this, but now release most of the positive reviews saying Samsung has fixed their software are likely paid or endorsed reviews.",samsung,1
"This is a great phone. The new phones are generally obscenely large, especially for someone who uses a belt holster. This one is still large, but slightly smaller than my S8+ and big enough to do everything I need. I love that the phone is unlocked.

"The commercials and reviews on this phone made it seem spectacular. When it was on a lightening deal on Amazon, this made it an even better deal - so I got it. The phone is slender but long, compared to my old phone (different brand) The larger screen would have been better, Transferring my info from the old phone to this one took about 45 minutes. Again, the commercials and reviews make it look like it does it instantly. Using this phone to give someone else a charge uses a lot of your battery power. I added 20% to another phone and it took 30% off this phone. There have been so many updates in the 24 hours I have had it and every time an update is downloaded or uploaded, the brightness goes to almost dark and I have to go into settings and go to display and pull the brightness level back up. It also feels like its for a left-handed person the way they have some of the things set up on it. It will take some getting use to but its defiantly is not worth $900. The smaller screen makes it difficult to use the keyboard - its too easy to ""fat finger"" and mis-spell words. This is from the first 24 hours. I will update later if anything gets better or worse.",samsung,1
"I bought this phone during Amazon's July 2019 Prime Day since it had a nice discount and my old S7 was getting slow and a little wonky. I was a bit nervous given the various reviews people have given but, decided to risk it. As of this writing, I've only had it 4 days so it's possible my 5 star review could change. That said, here's what I know so far:
This phone IS indeed an unlocked US version and most definitely has the Snapdragon processor. I moved my sim card over from my old phone and it activated flawlessly and quickly on Verizon's network. I'm still learning the various nuances and features of the phone, but so far I'm impressed. The phone is very fast, the graphics and performance are excellent and the battery life is a significant improvement over my S7. I still can't find specifics about what the stated ""limited Warranty"" actually is and I'd like to know that. I am considering a square trade or some other warranty in case of accidents but, they seem to be VERY expensive. I am careful but, accidents do happen.
Anyway, my bottom line is the description, though brief, was accurate and so far I'm very pleased with the phone and the discounted price I paid.",samsung,1
I've had a lot of smartphones for before I thought this was one of the best the cameras fantastic. Then add the rest of the phone I absolutely then at work the voice recognition was horrible it wasn't fast I've had got an LG Stylo 5 that's twice as quick as this phone it's way overpriced and it's not worth the money I don't think it's a very good small phone at all that's just my personal opinion that's not one of the best phones I had it's more like one of the worst phones I had,samsung,1

The sound and picture quality are great, the photos are wonderful, the battery life is outstanding. The only thing I didn't like is the location of the fingerprint sensor. I'm used to the sensor being on the back of the phone and find it convenient. This phone (S10) has the sensor on the front. But that's not enough to not give it a full 5-star rating!",samsung,1

~Runs fine
~Camera is awesome
~Awesome dispaly
Cons-:
Samsung really need to step up when it comes to basic .
~Very poor network reception, many places my s9+ have 50% more network connection.
~When you are taking a call from Wifi and move out of network the call disconnects(Whatsapp) , this was not happening in s9+ although there was 2/3 sec interruption . Wifi to LTE movement is not seamless

"I did not buy this from Amazon in all fairness, but I use Amazon for a lot of my purchases so I figured I'd post my review here. As a longtime android user (10 years), mostly with nexus devices, I can honestly say this phone was the worst user experience I've had in the android ecosystem. Issues with the fingerprint reader and Samsung constantly prompting me to use their apps for standard Google services soured me quickly. The only positive I can say for this phone is the camera and video capabilities. This phone killed android for me after 6 months of ownership and I replaced it with an apple 11 pro max. I never thought I would leave the android ecosystem, but the poor user experience sealed the deal.",samsung,0
"SMARTPHONE INTRO
I've been buying the latest and greats smartphones since the early HTC days and have owned just about every significant Samsung smartphone release since then. Every year I will stray over to other manufacturers to see what the big and small players are up to. Most, but not all of the time, I find myself right back to my Samsung phone as the daily driver. Which is usually a Note. Now that Samsung has released another Note series for an increasingly high price, let's see how it does. In particular against my Note 9 that it's replacing.
PROS:
+ Excellent build quality
+ The high-resolution OLED display somehow looks even better than before
+ Superfast performance; zero lag
+ Much improved speakers that you can *feel*
+ The bezels continue to disappear; nearly all-screen
+ Core functions, such as phone calls, still work great
+ Lots of internal storage + expandable storage
+ Generous battery that truely lasts all-day
+ Fast wired and wireless charging for those very heavy phone usage days
+ The ever-useful stylus continues to evolve
+ 3 Camera Lenses for any scenario
+ Great picture & video quality with some useful features
CONS:
- Hole punch camera is distracting
- The in-screen fingerprint reader takes a few steps back from the physical sensor
- RIP headphone jack
- Price keeps going up
DESIGN
Compared to the Galaxy Note 9, the Galaxy Note 10+ feels much more substantial than I expected. It has more heft and somehow even more solid feel to it. In particular with the Samsung OEM cases. Which are also expensive, but continue the high-quality impression of what you are holding in the hand.
The left side has the volume up/down and power button. The bottom is USB-C port and stylus holder. The rest of the phone is fairly clean and simple. I prefer power on the right, but it's easy enough to get used to after a few hours. I opted for the white version to mix things up and I like it. It still provides a nice high-end look all while resisting visible fingerprints (and probably scratches) than most darker and shinier colors.
Even with a 6.8"" display, it's still roughly the same size as the Note 9. There is now simply less bezel. But due to the squared corners, it never feels small. If you aren't already used to large phones, this will take some getting used to. And as manufacturers continue to slowly push the size of phones combined with no more bezels to shrink, this is probably about as large as I expect a mainstream phone to go. Any further and folks are going to have issues.
SOFTWARE
Long ago this used to be Samsung's weakest point. They'd throw lots of half-baked features with no optimization, resulting in lots of lag and bloat. Those days are long gone. Samsung nailed that down with the Galaxy S9/Note 9 series. Except with the Note 10, it's even faster, and smoother. Which I suspect much credit goes toward the Snapdragon 855.
I should note that I am a fan of Google's Android Experience. But every time I jump over to a Google phone (or another brand), I immediately start to miss all of the small but very useful features Samsung has built into their phone. The game launcher, scene optimizer, multiple lenses, display quality, high-end specs, etc.
And honestly, after easily disabling Bixby, there isn't that much bloat. Disable/Remove a few random apps like Facebook and I'm good to go.
PERFORMANCE
As noted above, the performance is absolutely fantastic. Usually while going through initial setup or installing apps, these phones tend to get very laggy. This was probably the only time I saw a hint of lag, but surprisingly minimal. In that, I could easily and quickly perform other tasks while downloading and installing apps, games, music, etc.
Each year as performance increases, the need for synthetic benchmarks decrease. I think they still serve a purpose in limited use-cases for a ""reliable"" baseline. But today, I'm not going to bother. This phone is fast and can do everything you want.
DISPLAY & AUDIO
The 6.8"" WQHD+ Dynamic AMOLED display combined with some significantly improved speakers are simply the best upgrades from previous phones. Watching high-resolution content on YouTube or Netflix look and sound fantastic. I found myself glued to the screen during my demo session with various clips.
Even the icons on the desktop almost pop from the screen. As though they are right there touching your fingers.
The speakers finally have some force behind them as well. Allowing you to ""feel"" the vibrations in your hand. And yes, they are quite loud. With Atmos-enabled they provide a great stereo separation effect.
I'll also mention there is an included screen protected. It's very thin but it's quite unobtrusive. I usually remove these. But since it virtually covers the entire screen and provides a smooth swiping experience, I'll leave it for now.
And last I'll briefly mention the hole punch as it does have a negative impact with the multimedia experience. Anytime there is a bright scene around that area, my eyes are immediately drawn to it. This needs go away sooner rather than later.
CAMERAS
As the camera count increases, so too does the usefulness, functionality, and flexibility. The rear now has a 16MB ultra-wide camera, 12MP wide-angle camera (normal), and 12MP telephoto camera. The introduction of wide-angle is super useful and one I use very often. Each camera captures excellent pictures.
I told my Pixel 3 and don't have it for comparison today. Are there better cameras available? I'm sure there are. But unless you are really comparing back-to-back, I doubt you'd notice. In particular, if you like to record video. That's one area the Pixel and some other phones don't do as well. The stability and clarity when recording 4K @ 60fp is excellent. Combined with solid audio recording and you've got a great overall camera package.
I'm not into selfies, but that 10MP camera is somewhat mandatory these days. It's unfortunate it has resulted in a small but very noticeable hole in the screen. Which as noted above, is absolutely noticeable. In either case, it takes solid pictures as well. No complaints there.
FINGERPRINT READER
Unfortunately, there is another negative feature change. With the Galaxy Note 9, and virtually every other phone with a physical reader, you can just rest your finger and quickly unlock/wake your phone. With Samsung's implementation of the in-screen reader, you have to press firmly and wait a second for it to register. And if it doesn't read your fingerprint right away, it may be a few seconds or repeated attempts.
If the screen is turned on, it does tend to be quicker. But you still need to press firmly and wait longer than in the past. I'm really hoping a software update improves this. Otherwise, I may just go back to the power button and a pin.
DEX & ""YOUR PHONE""
There are a lot of other software features, but I did want to highlight these two as they are unique and stand out for me. I got used to Dex with my last Samsung phone. And there continue to be minor but useful improvements. Dex is surprisingly useful if you want to do some light work. When I'm on-the-go I can easily plug in a USB-C to HDMI cable, Bluetooth keyboard/mouse and have a portable desktop experience. You can also now use a normal USB cable and windows app to access Dex, it's just not ideal for games and multimedia.
I've got personal and work e-mail, browser, youtube, office apps, and a range of other tools. I don't need to do video or photo editing on the go. And I found this can meet just about any task I need or want to do while traveling. This is a little more useful on a tablet, but in a different way, as the keyboard is already included. Less to travel with.
And then there is the new Your Phone feature. This is a little more ""early stage"" in development, but still handy. Just plug in a USB cable to any Windows PC and you can mirror what's on your phone. You also have direct access to messages, but the mirror function is nice. You can interact with your phone, on the PC. All while charging it.
I'd like to see more dedicated ports into this app. But being able to see and respond to any notification is great. Just don't expect to play games or smoothly stream youtube.
THE PHONE
That's right, this is still a phone. And as such, it needs to make phone calls! And other core functions. As I use this for both personal and work, this is a critical but often overlooked feature. While it may feel like more of a check-box item, I've had more than a few phones over the years that still fail in this arena.
I'm pleased to report that phone calls and text are excellent. Speakerphone works well. No issues with hearing anybody and vice versa. The radios appear to be good quality. Bluetooth is reliable as well as wi-fi, which is very fast. I'm easily pushing 300-400Mbps up/down with my Google Mesh Wireless network.
CONCLUSION
So how exactly do you justify a $1,100 phone? Honestly, you really don't justify it. At least not in the traditional sense. My Note 9 would have continued to serve me well for another year. But we buy these phones because they're interesting, they entertain us, and they make life a little bit easier. And considering the significant percentage of time many of us spend on these portable gadgets, it starts to make sense that we want to allocate more budget towards them.
While it's not perfect (no phone is), I still believe Samsung has enough features, functionality, quality, and performance for me to ""justify"" the Galaxy Note 10+'s price and keep it as my daily driver for another year. I'll still grab a few more phones that intrigue me between now and the Note 11, but I'd be surprised if they truly replaced this one. If they can, I'd welcome it.",samsung,1
"My New Note 10+ arrived Tuesday Morning. Having Owned The Note 1, Note 2, Note 4, Note 7 (for a few hours before it was recalled), and the Note 8, I had more than a few expectations. After 6 days of ownership, i can honestly say every expectation was meet or exceeded. Battery Life unbelievable. Screen excellent. Included software, great. Have used it on both Verizon & AT&T with no problems. Not expecting any problems in Europe in a few weeks, in multiple countries, with 2 more service provider's SIMs With 512GB built in, and my installed 512GB Micro SD Card, I can carry with me every document, every picture, every video that i want to not only for areas without or high priced Wi-Fi, but also as a secure backup for my small business files. So Why am I sorry? I am sorry for the external battery sellers - I don't need to carry one with me. Sorry that I have purchased multiple QC3 vehicle chargers. Don't need most of them. Almost sorry I have 3 tablets, 2 at offices, 1 at home. Have not quite given those up, but they may end up for sale. Is the phone overpriced? Of course it is, however it is something I use virtually every waking hour. Extremely pleased with it!",samsung,1

"I'll keep this short, phone is great and all but moving from the Rog phone to this one is super hard, and this is mainly because the refresh rate 120 back to 60 is actually kind of straining on the eyes now ( eyes are kind of sensitive). Besides this everything else is great, oh and if you don't like the hole punch in the middle because of video watching there is like this semi full screen mode that just black bars the side and it's great, but 60hz on a $1200 phone hurts the soul.",samsung,1
"Slightly concerned as the box had been opened before getting to me. The phone seems to be new from everything I can tell, but that took some of my excitement away...not knowing for sure if someone had handled the phone prior to me. The sticker that is usually on the back of the phone was not present...you could see where it had been. The phone is quite nice, although not sure it's worth 1200 bucks. The camera is not really what the YouTube reviewers say it is...it does a lot of softening to faces...even with beauty mode turned off. Not sure if I'm keeping the phone after all of the above...still deciding.",samsung,0
The phone was defective out of the box. I had spent hours on setup before I realized. I contacted Samsung support got a tech that knew less about the phone than I did grrr...hate that wasted my time and still didn't work. My S pen would not operate the camera. One of the features I upgraded for from the note 8. Basic features were fine it's a good phone but I bought it for a camera upgrade. Just a waste of time I just plan to return..what if the next one has another problem? Oh the pictures were not much improved.,samsung,0

This one is a de facto evolution to those phones. It takes awesome pictures, it is buttery smooth in terms of speed, the pen features improved (however, it is smaller). Everyone is jealous because of the screen size and capabilities.
The only downside to the phone is the fact it is north of $1000 pushing towards the $1500 once you get the 512 GB Storage, the 512GB SD Card, Insurance and an OtterBox Defender!
As a consolation prize, Amazon was cool to throw in one of those nifty 2nd Gen Echo Plus that was tied into it as a promotion. Nobody came close as a promo item.",samsung,1

"Upgraded to this phone from Samsung Galaxy S9+. There are some stuff that i like and some other stuff i really hate.
Okay here comes the cons; first, the on-screen fingerprint reader, compared to my S9+ fingerprint scanner, the on-screen is trash. Very hard to read and even if i get it to read, it takes more time to unlock than the S9+. Iris scanner is gone, which is quite unfortunate due to the trash on-screen scanner. The other part i dont like is the location of the power button, the power button is now combined with the useless Bixby and located on the left side, right under the volume button. I find it very hard to reach and sometimes get mixed up with the volume button. I'd rather have it on the right side. The aux is now gone too but not as much as a big deal for me, i just hate to see it gone. The battery doesn't last as long as i would like it to be, given i have to charge at least twice a day. Oh and one more thing, the notification light is now gone, there are apps to enable light notification on screen but I'd rather have the led than led rings on my screen cause it might cause burn-in in the long run.
Okay now for the pros; the screen size and color is outstanding, bright and very pleasant to the eye. The S pen is great to have but not really a game changer for me. The screen is curved but not as curved as the S9+, which i highly prefer because it is so much easier to put on tempered glass. The sd card slot is still present on the Note 10+ but it was also on the S9+. Speakers are decent, nothing outstanding. Camera is okay-ish with additional wide angle camera. The cut out camera is great than having bezels on top and bottom. The Aura Glow color is Amazing.",samsung,0
"I wanted a dual-sim version with the biggest possible storage, and the product description says ""Number of SIM - Dual-SIM; SIM size - Nano-SIM (4FF) ; SIM Slot Type - SIM 1 + Hybrid (SIM or MicroSD)"".

"I've had this phone for a little over a month now and I have to say, it's a very nice phone. The screen is bright, the camera is good, and One UI somehow hasn't made me vomit, Bixby is also something you can just completely avoid, there's built in Win10 integration, and the S Pen is just awesome.
But the phone isn't perfect. Unfortunately the fingerprint reader isn't the best. It's slow, and often fails to recognize my fingerprint especially if my finger is dry. The lack of a 3.5mm jack hurts, and ruins the ""no compromise"" feel that the absolute top Samsung phone should have. And their attempt to force Samsung Calendar down my throat was annoying to say the least.
All in all, I would recommend this phone if you're willing to sacrifice the 3.5mm jack for the S Pen, but at the same time I really expect a near perfect experience for $1099.99.",samsung,1

"I absolutely love this device. As a power user gives me more than enough RAM, storage, and processing power.

"I purchased this phone after reading/watching many.. many reviews on You Tube and the Internet. I chose this phone for several reasons. One, it came with great Memory right out of the box. Two, no lag (very speedy between apps), Three, the stylus is Great!! I love to write notes and having extra features built into the stylus is just a bonus. Finally the Screen itself is just stunning. Pictures and movies are amazing on this display. It's large... but not to large. Even with the Phone protector (a Defender Otter Box) on its really not that big and fits into my pockets easy. I purchased additional memory for the already ample amount of memory that was on the phone already. I just wanted to keep my books and movies separate.
The primary reason why I got this phone is to replace my old LG Stylo 2. This was a large phone as well with a stylus. It had only 16GB of memory. I had this phone for several years and it still works fairly well. However, the battery was giving out on it and the memory was less than adequate. These were the primary reasons to upgrade. When I researched this phone I wanted one that would last several years again and have the memory and speed to keep up with future apps and software updates. The Note 10 Plus just fit the bill.",samsung,1
Galaxy note 10 plus is a great phone . I love the phone . But it was not what I expected . I was expecting a made in korea version instead I got a made in vietnam version. Disappointed as I ask the community they got the made in korea version . I bought this phone for 1099 usd when I check the price after 1 week price goes to 899 usd with a free samsung ear buds another disappointment. Packaging was also not reliable when I hold the package box I could feel the hollow Ness inside no safety bubble wraps may be that's why there was these scratches on the box . Although phone is good but the deal I got was a total loss for me . That's why only 3 stars,samsung,0
"I normally don’t buy flagship phones upon release but decided to get the Note because I have never had the Samsung Note line but can use it’s features.First great thing is the S pen I had no problem figuring out how to use this and now wondering how I ever lived without it.I much prefer using the pen to go though apps and I am actually the type of person who like to scratch out notes on a piece of paper.I just think it stimulates the thinking process,and the pen is great.As far as no headphone jack ,I been wireless for so long now a cord just gets in the way and won’t miss it at all.
Android 9 and Samsung UI 1.5 are fine but the new update (whenever it comes ) makes this phone probably the best android you can buy.The photo proximity feature is really cool and useful for doing projects,and the new update will finally get a worthy screen capture of recordings.Something needed on the Samsung line ,along with other improvements.I paired my phone with a Gear S3 watch and this is probably the first time Samsung has not abandoned an older product.I much prefer the Samsung in style looks and notifications along with exercise and paying are really my main watch things.The battery is excellent,the screen is amazing I don’t even notice the little hole.Both fingerprint and facial recognition have worked well with me.
Super happy with this phone and would recommend it as a work or personal phone to anyone in Android/Samsung universe.The smart switch from my S8+ worked very well.And it isn’t too big still fits in a pocket on a front shirt or in the pockets of my travel bags.",samsung,1
"I paid $1100 for this and I still got bubble in my screen, I opened up the box and there were like carton pieces on top of the phone and there were fingerprints all over the phone. Also why doesnt the screen protector cover the the entire screen, kinda looked like my screen protector isnt for the note 10+ love the phone so far except for the bubble and how it was packed.",samsung,0
"Update: Phone was replaced by a new one, and it seems as working better and it is charging faster than the previous one. I hope what I got is a great one. I really love the features of this phone.
It looks and do what I great phone does, it takes amazing pictures and the technology is amazing. I am learning everyday new things and so far I love my phone.
The bad side is it charges so slow so I am not sure if it is the phone issue or the charger. I don't know what I should do in this case. :( I would have giving 5 stars but I am not happy with the time charging because it takes forever. As I said I don't know if this is the phone issue or the charger.
Update: I removed the screen protector that comes with it as I got my own and surprise! some scratches on the screen. If I would have seen those before I would have returned it right away.",samsung,1
"The good:
-Really nice design and great looking phone
-Probably the best hardware on any flagship phone at this time
11/2019
- fullscreen bezeless
- large sturdy screen that's durable and the body is quite resistant to bending for a phone this size
- supports adding sd card storage of 1tab sdcards extending the 256gb + 1tb total storage = you'll never have to worry about running out of room for photos and videos on your phone ever again
- 4k video, slow motion, and super slow motion
-video motion stabilization is really good
- snapdragon 855 processor means its fast really fast
- nice stylus pen and can act as remote for some phone functions like camera controls
- it has a thin film screen protector installed by default
- you can set default storage of camera and downloads to sdcard and save your phone storage
- Multitasking is very fast and very smooth
- wireless charging and wireless power transfer
The bad:
- The onscreen fingerprint reader sucks, it doesn't work with most screen protectors and even when it does it will fail at least 30% of the time and is exceedingly frustrating if you need to unlock the phone in a jiffy for photos or videos
- the facial recognition so fails about that much and if you change your hairstyle or wear glasses and then stop it will not recognize you sometimes.
- the facial recognition requires good lighting or it will fail almost 100% of the time in the dark, this means if you're out on the streets or at a festival with minimal lighting it will not recognize your face
- it has a thin film screen protector installed by default that could interfere with additional screen protectors unless you remove it, but you'd have to know there was one in the first place which is not mentioned
- the default samsung camera software is inferior n picture taking to even the pixel 3 camera, I installed the google cam and use that instead of the Samsung camera in normal photo situations. The Samsung cam over saturates and loses detail in photos where the google can will capture more realistic results with more details and less photoshopped results that make the photos look almost fake.
- The default samsung messaging app is also really bad, it will compress any images and videos to such a degree that it will be totally blurry of you send things over SMS. It will also limit the size you can send beyond what other phones allow. Images you send will be subpar and pixelated. I had to switch to the google messenger downloaded from the play store; it is superior in every way and I can send things over like I was able to on my iPhone; the quality is much better than the compressed mess the Samsung default message app was doing
- the navigation swipes are hard to do sometimes due to the size of the screen and the keyboard layouts are not well designed for one handed use even in one handed mode, I had a much better one handed experience on my note4.
- this phone is near impossible to operate with just one hand most of the time
- the placement of the camera in the top left corner means when you try to take photos in landscape mode your fingers can easily obstruct a portion of the camera and show up in your photos. They should've kept it like the S10 where it's in the middle of the phone so your fingers would be a lot less likely to get in the way of the camera lense.
I haven't owned a note since the note 4, so for me this was a huge improvement in most areas and I was waiting for a fullscreen bezeless phone with an onscreen fingerprint reader so that's why I chose the note 10+ over the pixel 4xl. I also wanted the flagship phone with all the bells and whistles so I chose it over the s10+. I switched from a note to iPhone and being pissed at iPhone's limitations after 5 years, mostly related to storage and random apps disappearing into icloud, I decided I needed to go back to android and was waiting for the right phone.
I am overall very satisfied with the phone in the $600-700 price range, but wouldn't get it in the $1000 range due to some big flaws I mentioned above. I'd buy this phone again in this price range because i still it's great and in most ways its superior to the pixel and iPhone, but I think samsung could've done much better on this phone especially since this is their flagship model. Oh also Bixby is annoying and I turned that off right away. If this was full retail of over $1000 I'd sadly go back to using an iphone or pay $600-700 for a pixel 4xl.",samsung,1
"Like many of the others who like this phone we can't say enough about it either.
One note about it would be the importance of getting all the Samsung App updates, Play store updates and then finally the 2 major updates for the Android system, and the final updates to the 1st. Total up dates will take about 12 hrs with 500mb connections...
The features are by far to many to list here, that make the Apple I phone look like crap...
Everything came in the box and it is a brand new phone. We use TelTik for all our business T-Mobile accounts so you might want to give them a look, as the rates are the best in the USA. You must at least have a business license to get those great rates however.
It has the full Samsung warranty, and we needed some tech support with our accounts so Samsung on the phone had us install the app, smart tutor, and remotely remodified our accounts with Samsung and Google while we watched them control the phone as if they we're with us doing it in our office!
Amazon customer service in our opinion is one of the best and they won't stop working on a problem until it's solved and or will replace your phone with a brand new one in 48 hrs!!!
Lastly it is highly recommended to leave the factory glass protective cover on until you ""MUST"" replace it, and protect your new Samsung Note 10 Plus ""gem"" with an Otter box case cover also available on amazon and elsewhere...
IPhone users will never know what are missing!
The phone is unlocked and its very fast with its snapdragon processing unit.
Again your not alone with Samsung support and the real time remote access and service was amazing!!",samsung,1
"How long should it take to review a replacement request? Since I got this phone, the moisture detection alert turned on although it was never immersed in water. I have used a cold air flow to attempt to dry the port out, and have also completed a factory reset on the phone as suggested on the internet. This is a new phone. I have filed a replacement from the seller and it sits in ""review with customer service"" - I need a dependable phone. Hopefully they are more responsive to bad reviews.",samsung,0
Will NOT work with XFINITY Mobile...huh unlocked n bands are there COMCAST sez NOT COMPATIBLE....WHO is the liar????,samsung,0
"I bought both and the second was a refurbished. I could not tell a difference and paid $680 for the same phone that cost $1100. Definitely get the refurbished. Get a warranty still and heck you save big bucks. Unless you got it on Black Friday for $850 with my amazon CC I got another 20% off. Nice. I own both the IPHONE and Samsung and use both. Switch SIM cards when needed. Wish I could have to Sims with same number lol.
Reason I got the Samsung was the DEX and using my TV as the screen. And the android apps I have certain apps that work on Samsung vs IPhone. Watching movies and NFL games on phone then stream to my tv. Still figuring that out",samsung,1
"Phone is great. Earbuds are pointless because they go quiet in one ear after a few months, same thing happened with my Galaxy Note 9 earbuds. They should just stop including them and stop ""updating the firmware"" for them.",samsung,0
"I did not do enough homework before purchasing this. I have terrible cell coverage at my house for all carriers. I'm relegated to relying on Wi-Fi calling to be able to send and receive calls reliably from my house. because this phone is unlocked, my carrier will not support Wi-Fi calling even though they sell the exact phone and you guessed it, if you buy it from them, Wi-Fi calling works. visual voicemail is something I liked, so I was very annoyed to see that you also can't enable that. clearly this is not a problem of the phone, it points to the greed and control of the carrier's out there. if you're like me and must have Wi-Fi calling, then do not purchase an unlocked version of the phone. That said, the note 10 plus is arguably the best phone ever, so fast and so many great features; I love it!",samsung,0
So Delay f***** booring,samsung,0
"My Note 10+ is actually a great experience getting it unlocked. Not as loaded down with all the added apps that you can't remove. Samsung's has minimum. Only problem I have is Bixby. I can disable the button, but can't use it for what I want... Google assistant. Really?! I'm still determined to remove it when I swipe right on the home screen. Camera is still not as good as my Pixel 3xl, but I'm not complaining. Since I take photos of my rentals I didn't know how bad I needed the wide-angle lens.",samsung,0
"I took points off because the phone essentially arrived as an open box and everything had been knocked out of place inside. That is purely against Amazon for that, not Samsung. Despite this, the phone itself arrived in new condition.
As for the Phone itself: Overall 4.5/5
Pros-
Screen is beautiful and vivid
Phone is large, but not uncomforable (this is case-by-case as I have large hands)
Phone is extremely fast and responsive
Battery life is very good, I don't need to charge my phone before I leave work anymore.
S-pen is a great addition and I love taking notes while the screen is off and locked
Cons-
In-screen fingerprint scanner is not nearly as fast or reliable as the one normally on the back
Neither here nor there-
Facial recognition can be duped, but I never use it as I prefer fingerprint readers, because I don't want to pick my phone up every time I use it.
Overall, I am happy with the phone, but not with Amazon since somehow the sticker came off before or during shipping allowing everything in the box to move around.",samsung,1
"DONT BUY. CHEATER!!!
It says dual sim but it is just single sim.
Per description:
Number of SIM Dual SIM; SIM size Nano SIM (4FF) ; SIM Slot Type SIM 1 + Hybrid (SIM or MicroSD)",samsung,0
"I bought this a little sceptical. I'm a die hard Huawei fan. Just wanted to give this Samsung a trial. I'm not disappointed. Battery outlasts my Huawei Mate 20x5g,which is pleasant surprise. Given what people complain about in Samsungs. I enjoy the pen remote operation of the camera for group selfies. Facial recognition works fine, even in low light.-Beats Huawei in this as well. My only complaint is the email app in Samsung is not my taste. I give to my Huawei.",samsung,1
"Unlocked phones are not always an advantage. There are several features disabled on the phone like VIDEO CALLING, that are provided on the regular network phones and there is no way of enabling them. THIS SHOULD HAVE BEEN PROMINENTLY indicated on the description. There is workaround for this but not a clean alternative. I would have expected to have features that were standard on my 3 year old S7. If you can live with this shortcoming, it is a nice phone.",samsung,0
"Although you might like the huge screen, its definitely not worth 1000 bucks. There are other phones which are worth a lot less but have better battery life and camera. This was my first samsung galaxy note and it was not as good as i expected it to be.",samsung,0
"My Dad loves it already and he has yet to activate it! Good first impression to him considering he had an iPhone 6s before I got him this phone. If it turns out to be defective I'll be sure to change this review, but until then: nice phone Samsung; well done!",samsung,1
"I'm not sure where the poor reviews came from for purchasing this phone. The phone is stellar. It's fast, lots of storage, great camera, huge beautiful display. I received it without a single scratch or torn packaging. I move everything from my Note 8 in about an hour via smart switch sitting in my living room. No problems like some of the reviews I have read on this phone. Totally happy and it was a great deal.",samsung,1
"Not what we expected, thought screen would be bigger.",samsung,0
"I ordered this phone as I wanted something 5 G capable, not sure if that fact is possible, as it does not state that anywhere. However it is a beautiful piece. I cannot rate face or fingerprint capabilities as I do not have fingerprints. And facial is not for me. Battery is amazing, I have been able to use the phone all day doing many functions and the lowest the battery ever got was 67%. Beautiful piece.",samsung,1
I... am amazed. I don't know what else I could possibly say. As someone that's been exclusively using LG's Stylo line for the past 5 years I might as well be in the year 3006 😂 I love this phone!,samsung,1

"excellent product with all its added values ??that no other smartphone includes and at the same price as other high-end. the fluidity of the team is the best along with its autonomy, the big screen is excellent",samsung,1
"battery life couldvbe better as with most smartphones.
not so specal towarrant very high price",samsung,1
I like the phone but I guess i was expecting something more grandiose. Like apps and programs that no other phone had. thus far its just a phone. The Spen is nice when I remember its there. has a nice camera I use the phone for work so pictures come in real handy. I came over to samsung from the essential phone and I must say that I miss the essential phone. it has a newer android os and updates and it didnt cost me a mortgage payment,samsung,1
This one is the best smartphone out there right now.,samsung,1
"I've had a Note 5, 8, and now this Note 10 -- and it's simply the best device out there. I don't like the fingerprint reader at all, but the cameras are awesome!",samsung,1
Love the phone love this phone great pictures,samsung,1
"This device came used with a scratch so deep to the screen that you could feel it with your fingers.
Update they sent a replacement.",samsung,1
"I was kind of nervous about ordering a refurbished phone online, but all my doubts were quickly dissipated when I got these in the mail. I ordered two, one for me, and one for my husband. We had our S6's for 2.5 years and we'd been happy with them until recently, when we started noticing that they were showing their age. I started looking at S7's (I don't really care about having the latest and greatest, I just want it to work), and was pleasantly surprised to see that they have a better camera and expandable storage. It took a little work to get these hooked up with Verizon (we have a prepaid plan), but after about 2 hours, we got them working. They come in original packaging, with a new charging cord and a nifty little piece that allows you to hook your phone up to your old one and transfer all of your stuff. I use a cloud service for most of my pictures, but I was worried about my settings- the process they use allows you to transfer EVERYTHING over, and soon, my S7 looked and sounded exactly like my S6. I didn't lose anything. So far the battery life is much better than my S6, the camera is amazing, and I've put in a 32 gb SD card for extra storage (this is located in the same slot as the SIM card, so no extra ports, they just added some space on the tray). We've had these for about two weeks, and I have no complaints. I will give an update at a later date, good or bad.",samsung,1
Hi receive the phone today and your listing is misleading. They're is no warranty from Samsung as I attached a screenshot of the warranty page. The battery in this phone is terrible and the phone is to and a half years old and it has the original battery. If this was a certified use phone from Samsung they would put in a brand new battery and they charge $350 for these phones.,samsung,0
"Defective charging port right out of the box. Will not charge using different chargers , cables and even a wireless pad. Do not believe this item is factory refurbished. This is my 3rd galaxy phone ( 2nd refurbished) and I am VERY dissapointed. Also the charging port shows wear marks. Now I have no phone and have to wait for a replacement. Should had had red flags when data would not transfer from my S6 and I saw another person's apps on the phone. They seem to have just sent me someone's old phone.",samsung,0
